producing pdf output
=================================================================
Compiling the book into pdf format is fairly easy on a Linux
machine. Basically you just need to install some open-source
software. The following are the relevant packages on a Debian-based
system such as Ubuntu:
  texlive-full pdftk m4

You also need Ruby 1.9. As of November 2009, this the stable version,
but many older Linux distributions have 1.8. To test whether your
version of ruby is new enough to use, do this:
  make test_ruby
If you need to upgrade, you can download 1.9 from:
  http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/

From the main directory (the one where you found this README), just
do the command:
  make

I haven't tried compiling the books on MacOS X or Windows. I suspect
it could be done on MacOS X without any heroic measures, and I suspect
that it would be a real pain on Windows.

=================================================================
producing html output
=================================================================
To produce html output requires a little more software. First, you
need the following additional Debian packages:
  xpdf imagemagick tex4ht dvipng
(The xpdf dependency is because of pdftoppm, which comes bundled
with it.)

You'll also need footex:

translation
=================================================================
Currently my plan is to have translators use the wiki versions of the
books at:
  http://authors.ck12.org/wiki/index.php/CK12_Books#Ben_Crowell.27s_Physics_Books
If there is not yet a wiki-formatted version of the book, a first shot
can be produced by doing:
  make wiki
Some of the boilerplate phrases can then be translated like this:
  ../scripts/translate_boilerplate.pl -l fr <ch00/ch002.wiki >a.wiki

====================

More technical details about the software setup are in INTERNALS.
