``I always get a slight brain-shiver, now [that] space and time appear conglomerated together in a gray, miserable chaos.'' -- Sommerfeld

Why does the world need yet another book about relativity?
I had in mind the hope not necessarily of writing the best relativity
book ever, but perhaps of writing the best \emph{free} book at its level, where ``at its level'' means
that the book is meant to be accessible to advanced undergraduates, as well as to graduate students
who put their pants on one leg at a time.

This is mainly a book about general relativity, not special relativity.
I've heard the sentiment expressed that books on special relativity generally
do a lousy job on special relativity, compared to books on
general relativity. This is undoubtedly true, for someone who already has already
learned special relativity --- but wants to unlearn the parts that are completely wrong
in the broader context of general relativity. For someone who has \emph{not}
already learned special relativity, I strongly recommend mastering it first,
from a book such as Taylor and Wheeler's \emph{Spacetime Physics}.
Even an advanced student may be able to learn a great deal from
a masterfully written, nonmathematical treatment at an even lower level,
such as the ones in Hewitt's, \emph{Conceptual Physics} or
the inexpensive paperback by Gardner, \emph{Relativity Simply Explained}.

I should reveal at the outset that I am not a professional relativist. My field
of research was nonrelativistic nuclear physics until I became a community college
physics instructor. I can only hope that my pedagogical experience will compensate to some
extent for my shallow background, and that readers who find mistakes will be
kind enough to let me know about them using the contact information

<% begin_sec("Time and causality") %>

Updating Plato's allegory of the cave,
imagine two super-intelligent twins,
Alice and Betty. They're raised entirely by a robotic tutor on a
sealed space station, with no access to the outside world. The robot, in accord
with the latest fad in education, is programmed to encourage them to build
up a picture of all the laws of physics based on their own
experiments, without a textbook to tell them the right answers.
Putting yourself in the twins' shoes, imagine giving up all your
preconceived ideas about space and time, which may turn out according
to relativity to be completely wrong, or perhaps only approximations
that are valid under certain circumstances.

Causality is one thing the twins will notice. Certain events result
in other events, forming a network of cause and effect. One general
rule they infer from their observations is that there is an
unambiguously defined notion of \emph{betweenness}: if Alice observes
that event 1 causes event 2, and then 2 causes 3, Betty always agrees
that 2 lies between 1 and 3 in the chain of causality. They find that
this agreement holds regardless of whether one twin is standing on
her head (i.e., it's invariant under rotation), and regardless of
whether one twin is sitting on the couch while the other is zooming
around the living room in circles on her nuclear fusion scooter
(i.e., it's also invariant with respect to different states of
motion).

You may have heard that relativity is a theory that can be
interpreted using non-Euclidean geometry. The invariance of
betweenness is a basic geometrical property that is shared by both
Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry. We say that they are both
\emph{ordered} geometries. With this geometrical interpretation in mind, it will be
useful to think of events not as actual notable occurrences but
merely as an ambient sprinkling of \emph{points} at which things
\emph{could} happen. For example, if Alice and Betty are eating
dinner, Alice could choose to throw her mashed potatoes at Betty.
Even if she refrains, there was the potential for a causal linkage
between her dinner and Betty's forehead.

Betweenness is very weak.\label{no-global-causality}
Alice and Betty may also make a number of
conjectures that would say much more about causality. For example:
(i) that the universe's entire network of causality is connected,
rather than being broken up into separate parts; (ii) that the events
are globally ordered, so that for \emph{any} two events 1 and 2,
either 1 could cause 2 or 2 could cause 1, but not both; (iii) not
only are the events ordered, but the ordering can be modeled by
sorting the events out along a line, the time axis, and assigning a
number $t$, time, to each event. To see what these conjectures would
entail, let's discuss a few examples that may draw on knowledge from
outside Alice and Betty's experiences.

Example: According to the Big Bang theory, it seems likely that the
network is connected, since all events would presumably connect back
to the Big Bang. On the other hand, if (i) were false we might have
no way of finding out, because the lack of causal connections would
make it impossible for us to detect the existence of the other
universes represented by the other parts disconnected from our own
universe.

Example: If we had a time machine, we could violate (ii), but this
brings up paradoxes, like the possibility of killing one's own
grandmother when she was a baby, and in any case nobody knows how to
build a time machine.

Example: There are nevertheless strong reasons for believing that
(ii) is false. For example, if we drop Alice into one black hole, and
Betty into another, they will never be able to communicate again, and
therefore there is no way to have any cause and effect relationship
between Alice's events and Betty's.\footnote{This point is revisited in section \ref{sec:event-horizons}.}

Since (iii) implies (ii), we suspect that (iii) is false as well. But
Alice and Betty build clocks, and these clocks are remarkably
successful at describing cause-and-effect relationships within the
confines of the quarters in which they've lived their lives: events
with higher clock readings never cause events with lower clock
readings. They announce to their robot tutor that they've discovered
a universal thing called time, which explains all causal
relationships, and which their experiments show flows at the same rate
everywhere within their quarters.

``Ah,'' the tutor sighs, his metallic voice trailing off.

``I know that `ah', Tutorbot,'' Betty says. ``Come on, can't you just
tell us what we did wrong?''

``You know that my pedagogical programming doesn't allow that.''

``Oh, sometimes I just want to strangle whoever came up with those
stupid educational theories,'' Alice says.

The twins go on strike, protesting that the time theory works
perfectly in every experiment they've been able to imagine. Tutorbot
gets on the commlink with his masters and has a long, inaudible
argument, which, judging from the hand gestures, the twins imagine to
be quite heated. He announces that he's gotten approval for a field
trip for one of the twins, on the condition that she remain in a
sealed environment the whole time so as to maintain the conditions of
the educational experiment.

``Who gets to go?'' Alice asks.

``Betty,'' Tutorbot replies, ``because of the mashed potatoes.''

``But I refrained!'' Alice says, stamping her foot.

``Only one time out of the last six that I served them.''

The next day, Betty, smiling smugly, climbs aboard the sealed
spaceship carrying a duffel bag filled with a large collection of
clocks for the trip. Each clock has a duplicate left behind with Alice.
The clock design that they're proudest of consists of a tube with two
mirrors at the ends. A flash of light bounces back and forth between
the ends, with each round trip counting as one ``tick,'' one unit of
time. The twins are convinced that this one will run at a constant
rate no matter what, since it has no moving parts that could be
affected by the vibrations and accelerations of the journey.

Betty's field trip is dull. She doesn't get to see any of the outside
world. In fact, the only way she can tell she's not still at home is
that she sometimes feels strong sensations of acceleration. (She's
grown up in zero gravity, so the pressing sensation is novel to her.)
She's out of communication with Alice,
and all she has to do during the long voyage is to tend to her
clocks. As a crude check, she verifies that the light clock seems to
be running at its normal rate, judged against her own pulse. The
pendulum clock gets out of synch with the light clock during the
accelerations, but that doesn't surprise her, because it's a
mechanical clock with moving parts. All of the nonmechanical clocks
seem to agree quite well. She gets hungry for breakfast, lunch, and
dinner at the usual times.

When Betty gets home, Alice asks, ``Well?''

``Great trip, too bad you couldn't come. I met some cute boys, went
out dancing, \ldots''

``You did not. What about the clocks?''

``They all checked out fine. See, Tutorbot? The time theory still
holds up.''

``That was an anticlimax,'' Alice says. ``I'm going back to bed now.''

``Bed?'' Betty exclaims. ``It's three in the afternoon.''

The twins now discover that although all of Alice's clocks agree
among themselves, and similarly for all of Betty's (except for the
ones that were obviously disrupted by mechanical stresses), Alice's
and Betty's clocks disagree with one another. A week has passed for
Alice, but only a couple of days for Betty.

<% begin_sec("The Hafele-Keating experiment") %>\label{sec:hafele-keating}\index{Hafele-Keating experiment}\index{atomic clocks}
In 1971, J.C. Hafele and R.E. Keating\footnote{Hafele and Keating, Science, 177 (1972), 168}
of the U.S. Naval Observatory brought atomic clocks aboard commercial
airliners and went around the world, once from east to west and once from west to east. (The clocks had their
own tickets, and occupied their own seats.) As in the parable of
Alice and Betty, Hafele and Keating observed that there was a discrepancy between the times measured by the
traveling clocks and the times measured by similar clocks that stayed at the lab in Washington.
The result was that the east-going clock lost an amount of time $\Delta t_E=-59\pm10$ ns, while the west-going one gained $\Delta t_W=+273\pm7$ ns.
This establishes that time is not universal and absolute.

<%
  fig(
    'atomic-clock-boarding-plane',
    %q{The atomic clock has its own ticket and its own seat.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>
Nevertheless, causality was preserved. The
nanosecond-scale effects observed were small compared to the three-day lengths of the plane trips. There was no
opportunity for paradoxical situations such as, for example, a scenario in which the east-going experimenter arrived
back in Washington before he left and then proceeded to convince himself not to take the trip.

Hafele and Keating were testing specific quantitative predictions of relativity, and they verified them to within
their experiment's error bars. At this point in the book, we aren't in possession of enough relativity to be able
to make such calculations, but, like Alice and Betty, we can inspect the empirical results for clues as to how 
time works.

The opposite signs of the two results suggests that the rate at which time flows depends on the motion
of the observer. The east-going clock was moving in the same direction as the earth's rotation, so its velocity
relative to the earth's center was greater than that of the ones that remained in Washington, while the west-going clock's velocity was
correspondingly reduced.\footnote{These differences in velocity are not simply something that can be eliminated by
choosing a different frame of reference, because the clocks' motion isn't in a straight line. The clocks back
in Washington, for example, have a certain acceleration toward the earth's axis, which is different from the
accelerations experienced by the traveling clocks.} The signs of the $\Delta t$'s show that moving clocks
were slower.

On the other hand, the asymmetry of the results, with $|\Delta t_E| \ne |\Delta t_W|$,
implies that there was a second effect involved, simply due to the planes' being up in the air. Relativity predicts
that the time's rate of flow also changes with height in a gravitational field. The deeper reasons for such an
effect are given in section \ref{sec:pound-rebka} on page \pageref{sec:pound-rebka}.\label{gravity-affects-time}

Although Hafele and Keating's measurements were on the ragged edge of the state of the art in 1971, technology has
now progressed to the point where similar effects have everyday consequences. The satellites of the Global
Positioning System (GPS) orbit at a speed of $1.9\times 10^3$ m/s, an order of magnitude faster than a
commercial jet. Their altitude of 20,000 km is also much greater than that of an aircraft.
For both these reasons, the relativistic effect on time is stronger than in the Hafele-Keating experiment.
The atomic clocks aboard the satellites are tuned to a frequency of 10.22999999543 MHz, which is
perceived on the ground as 10.23 MHz. (This frequency shift will be calculated in example \ref{eg:gps}
on page \pageref{eg:gps}.

<% end_sec %> % Hafele-Keating


<% begin_sec("Muons") %>
Although the Hafele-Keating experiment is impressively direct, it was not the first verification of relativistic
effects on time, it did not completely separate the kinematic and gravitational effects, and the effect was small.
In 1941, Rossi and Hall detected cosmic-ray muons\index{cosmic rays}\index{muon} at the summit and base of
Mount Washington in New Hampshire. The muon has a mean lifetime of 2.2 $\mu\zu{s}$, and the time of flight
between the top and bottom of the mountain (about 2 km for muons arriving along a vertical path) at nearly the
speed of light was about 7 $\mu\zu{s}$, so in the absence of relativistic effects, the flux at the bottom of the mountain
should have been smaller than the flux at the top by about an order of magnitude. The observed ratio was
much smaller, indicating that the ``clock'' constituted by nuclear decay processes was dramatically slowed down
by the motion of the muons.

<% begin_sec("Gravitational redshifts") %>\label{gravitational-redshifts}
The first  experiment that isolated the gravitational effect on time was a 1925 measurement by W.S. Adams of the spectrum
of light emitted from the surface of the white dwarf star Sirius B. The gravitational field at the surface of Sirius B
is $4\times 10^5 g$, and the gravitational potential is about 3,000 times greater than at the Earth's surface. The emission lines of hydrogen were redshifted,
i.e., reduced in frequency,
and this effect was interpreted as a slowing of time at the surface of Sirius 
relative to the surface of the Earth.\index{redshift!gravitational}\index{Adams, W.S.}\index{Sirius B}
Historically, the mass and radius of Sirius were not known with better than order of magnitude precision in 1925,
so this observation did not constitute a good quantitative test.

The first such experiment to be carried out under controlled conditions,
by Pound and Rebka in 1959, is analyzed quantitatively in example \ref{eg:pound-rebka} on page \pageref{eg:pound-rebka}.\index{Pound-Rebka experiment}

The first high-precision experiment of this kind was Gravity Probe A, a 1976 experiment\footnote{Vessot at al., Physical Review Letters 45 (1980) 2081} in which
a space probe was launched vertically from Wallops Island, Virginia, at less than escape velocity, to an altitude of 10,000 km, after which
it fell back to earth and crashed down in the Atlantic Ocean. The probe carried a hydrogen maser clock which was used to control the frequency of a
radio signal. The radio signal was received on the ground, the nonrelativistic Doppler shift was subtracted out, and the residual blueshift was
interpreted as the gravitational effect effect on time, and matched the relativistic prediction to an accuracy of 0.01\%.\index{Gravity Probe A}

We've seen that time flows at different rates for different observers.
Suppose that Alice and Betty repeat their Hafele-Keating-style experiment, but this time they are allowed to
communicate during the trip. Once Betty's ship completes its initial acceleration away from Betty,
she  cruises at constant speed, and girl has her own equally valid
inertial frame of reference. Each twin considers herself to be at rest, and says that the other is the one who
is moving. Each one says that the other's clock is the one that is slow. If they could pull out their phones
and communicate instantaneously, with no time lag for the propagation of the signals, they could resolve the controversy.
Alice could ask Betty, ``What time does your clock read right \emph{now}?'' and get an immediate answer back.

By the symmetry of their frames of reference, however, it seems that that Alice and Betty should  \emph{not} be able
to resolve the controversy \emph{during} Betty's trip. If they could, then they could release two radar beacons that
would permanently establish two inertial frames of reference, A and B, such that time flowed, say, more slowly in B than in
A. This would violate the principle that motion is relative, and that all inertial frames of reference are equally valid.
The best that they can do is to compare clocks once Betty returns, and verify that the net result of the trip was to
make Betty's clock run more slowly \emph{on the average}.

Alice and Betty can never satisfy their curiosity about exactly when
during Betty's voyage the discrepancies accumulated or at what rate.
This is information that they can never obtain, but they could obtain it if they had a system for
communicating instantaneously. We conclude that instantaneous communication is impossible. There must be some maximum
speed at which signals can propagate --- or, more generally, a maximum speed at which cause and effect can propagate ---
and this speed must for example be greater than or equal to the speed at which radio waves propagate.
It is also evident from these considerations that simultaneity itself cannot be a meaningful concept in
relativity.

<% begin_sec("Ordered geometry") %>
You've probably heard that general relativity is a geometrical theory.
Let's try to put what we've learned into a general geometrical context.

Euclid's familiar geometry of two-dimensional space has the following
axioms,\footnote{These axioms are summarized for quick reference in the back of the book on page
\pageref{euclidean-summary}.} which are expressed in terms of operations that can be carried out with a compass and unmarked straightedge:\label{euclidean-axioms}
\begin{itemize}
\item[E1] Two points determine a line.
\item[E2] Line segments can be extended.
\item[E3] A unique circle can be constructed given any point as its center and any line segment as its radius.
\item[E4] All right angles are equal to one another.
\item[E5] \emph{Parallel postulate:} Given a line and a point not on the line, no more than one line
          can be drawn through the point and parallel to the given line.\footnote{This is a form known as Playfair's axiom, rather than the version of the
                   postulate originally given by Euclid.}
\end{itemize}

The modern style in mathematics is to consider this type of axiomatic
system as a self-contained sandbox, with the axioms, and any theorems
proved from them, being true or false only in relation to one another.
Euclid and his contemporaries, however, believed them to be self-evident
facts about physical reality. For example, they considered the
fifth postulate to be less obvious than the first four, because in order
to verify physically that two lines were parallel, one would theoretically
have to extend them to an infinite distance and make sure that they never crossed.
In the first 28 theorems of the \emph{Elements}, Euclid restricts himself entirely
to propositions that can be proved based on the more secure first four postulates.
The more
general geometry defined by omitting the parallel postulate is known as \emph{absolute geometry}.\index{absolute geometry}

What kind of geometry is likely to be applicable to general relativity?
We can see immediately that Euclidean geometry, or even absolute geometry,
would be far too specialized. We have in mind the description of events that are points
in both space and time. Confining ourselves for ease of visualization to one dimension
worth of space, we can certainly construct a plane described by coordinates $(t,x)$,
but imposing Euclid's postulates on this plane results in physical nonsense.
Space and time are physically distinguishable from one another. But postulates 3 and
4 describe a geometry in which distances measured along non-parallel axes are comparable,
and figures may be freely rotated without affecting the truth or falsehood of statements
about them; this is only appropriate for a physical description of different spacelike directions,
as in an $(x,y)$ plane whose two axes are indistinguishable.

We need to throw most of the specialized apparatus of Euclidean geometry
overboard. Once we've stripped our geometry to a bare minimum, then we can
go back and build up a different set of equipment that will be better suited
to relativity.

The stripped-down geometry we want is called \emph{ordered geometry}, and was
developed by Moritz Pasch around 1882.\index{Pasch!Moritz} As suggested by the parable of Alice and Betty,
ordered geometry does not have any global, all-encompassing system of measurement.
When Betty goes on her trip, she traces out a particular path through the space of
events, and Alice, staying at home, traces another. Although events play out in
cause-and-effect order along each of these paths, we do not expect to be able to
measure times along paths A and B and have them come out the same. This is how
ordered geometry works: points can be put in a definite order along any particular
line, but not along different lines.  Of the four
primitive concepts used in Euclid's E1-E5 --- point, line, circle, and angle ---
only the non-metrical notions of point (i.e., event) and line are relevant in ordered geometry.
In a geometry without measurement, there is no concept of measuring distance (hence no
compasses or circles), or of measuring angles. The notation [ABC] indicates that event B lies on a line
segment joining A and C, and is strictly between them.
<% marg(0) %>
<%
  fig(
    'ordered-geometry',
    %q{Axioms O2 (left) and O3 (right).}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

The axioms of ordered geometry are as follows:\footnote{The axioms are summarized for convenient reference in the back
of the book on page \pageref{ordered-summary}. This is meant to be an informal, readable summary of the system,
pitched to the same level of looseness as Euclid's E1-E5. Modern mathematicians have found that systems like these actually
need quite a bit more technical machinery to be perfectly rigorous, so if you look up an axiomatization of ordered geometry,
or a modern axiomatization of Euclidean geometry,
you'll typically find a much more lengthy list of axioms than the ones presented here. The axioms I'm omitting take care
of details like making sure that there are more than two points in the universe, and that
curves can't cut through one another intersecting. The classic, beautifully written book on these topics is
H.S.M. Coxeter's \emph{Introduction to Geometry}, which is ``introductory'' in the sense that it's the kind of book a college
math major might use in a first upper-division course in geometry.}\label{ordered-geometry-axioms}
\begin{itemize}
\item[O1] Two events determine a line.
\item[O2] Line segments can be extended: given A and B, there is at least one event such that [ABC] is true.
\item[O3] Lines don't wrap around: if [ABC] is true, then [BCA] is false.
\item[O4] Causality: Any three distinct events A, B, and C lying on the same line can be sorted out in order (and by statement 3, this order is unique).
\end{itemize}

O1-O2 express the same ideas as Euclid's E1-E2. Not all lines in the system will correspond physically to
chains of causality; we could have a line segment that describes a snapshot of a steel chain, and O3-O4
then say that the order of the links is well defined. But O3 and O4 also have clear physical significance for
lines describing causality.
O3 forbids time travel paradoxes, like going back in time and killing our own grandmother as a child.
O4 says that events are guaranteed to have a well-defined cause-and-effect order only if they lie on the same
line. This is completely different from the attitude expressed in Newton's famous statement: ``Absolute, true and mathematical time, of itself, and
from its own nature flows equably without regard to anything external \ldots''

If you're dismayed by the austerity of a system of geometry without any notion of measurement, you may be
even more dismayed to learn that even a system as weak as ordered geometry makes some statements that are too
strong to be completely correct as a foundation for relativity. For example, if an observer falls into a black
hole, at some point he will reach a central point of infinite density, called a singularity.\index{singularity}
At this point, his chain of cause and effect terminates, violating statement 2.
It is also an open question whether O3's prohibition on time-loops actually holds in general relativity;
this is Stephen Hawking's playfully named chronology protection conjecture.\index{chronology protection conjecture}\index{Hawking!Stephen}
We'll also see that in general relativity O1 is almost always true, but there are exceptions.

What physical interpretation should we give to the ``lines'' described in ordered geometry?
Galileo described an experiment (which he may or may not have actually performed) in which he simultaneously
dropped a cannonball and a musket ball from a tall tower. The two objects hit the ground simultaneously,
disproving Aristotle's assertion that objects fell at a speed proportional to their weights. On a graph of
spacetime with $x$ and $t$ axes, the curves traced by the two objects, called their \emph{world-lines},\index{world-line}
are identical parabolas. (The paths
of the balls through $x-y-z$ space are straight, not curved.) One way of explaining this observation is that
what we call ``mass'' is really two separate things, which happen to be equal.
\emph{Inertial mass}\index{mass!inertial}\index{inertial mass}, which appears in Newton's $a=F/m$, describes
how difficult it is to accelerate an object. 
\emph{Gravitational mass}\index{mass!gravitational}\index{gravitational mass} describes the strength with which
gravity acts. The cannonball has a hundred times more gravitational mass than the musket ball, so the force
of gravity acting on it is a hundred times greater. But its inertial mass is also precisely a hundred times
greater, so the two effects cancel out, and it falls with the same acceleration. This is a special property
of the gravitational force. Electrical forces, for example, do not behave this way. The force that an object
experiences in an electric field is proportional to its charge, which is unrelated to its inertial mass,
so different charges placed in the same electric field will in general have \emph{different} motions.

Einstein realized that this special property of the gravitational force made it possible to describe
gravity in purely geometrical terms. We define the
world-lines of objects acted on by gravity to be the lines described by the axioms of the geometry.
Since we normally think of the ``lines'' described by Euclidean geometry and its kin as \emph{straight} lines,
this amounts to a redefinition of what it means for a line to be straight. By analogy, imagine stretching
a piece of string taut across a globe, as we might do in order to plan an airplane flight or aim a
directional radio antenna. The string may not appear straight as viewed from the three-dimensional Euclidean
space in which the globe is embedded, but it is as straight as possible in the sense that it is the path
followed by a radio wave,\index{Radio waves in the HF band tend to be trapped between the ground and the ionosphere,
causing them to curve over the horizon, allowing long-distance communication.} or by an airplane pilot who keeps her wings level and her rudder straight.
The world-``line'' of an object acted on by nongravitational forces is not considered to be a straight ``line''
in the sense of O1-O4. When necessary, one eliminates this ambiguity in the overloaded term ``line'' by referring
to the lines of O1-O4 \emph{geodesics}.\index{geodesics}
The world-line of an object acted on only by gravity is one type of geodesic.

We can now see the deep physical importance of statement O1, that two events determine a line.\label{unique-geodesics}
To predict the trajectory of a golf ball, we need to have some initial data. For example, we could measure
event A when the ball breaks contact with the club, and event B an infinitesimal time after
A.\footnote{Regarding infinitesimals, see p. \pageref{infinitesimals}.}
This pair of observations can be thought of as fixing the ball's initial position and velocity, which should
be enough to predict a unique world-line for the ball, since relativity is a deterministic theory.
With this interpretation, we can also see why it is not necessarily a disaster for the theory if O1 fails
sometimes. For example, event A could mark the launching of two satellites into circular orbits from the same place on the
Earth, heading in opposite directions, and B could be their subsequent collision on the opposite side of the planet.
Although this violates O1, it doesn't violate determinism. Determinism only requires the validity of O1 for
events infinitesimally close together. Even for randomly chosen events far apart, the probability that they will
violate O1 is zero.

<% begin_sec("E\\\"{o}tv\\\"{o}s experiments") %>
Einstein's entire system breaks down if there is any violation, no matter how small, of the proportionality
between inertial and gravitational mass, and it therefore becomes very interesting to search experimentally
for such a violation. For example, we might wonder whether neutrons and protons had slightly different ratios of
gravitational and inertial mass, which in a Galileo-style experiment would cause a small difference between
the acceleration of a lead weight, with a large neutron-to-proton ratio, and a wooden one, which consists
of light elements with nearly equal numbers of neutrons and protons. The first high-precision experiments
of this type were performed by E\"{o}tv\"{o}s around the turn of the twentieth century, and they verified
the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass to within about one part in $10^8$. Measurements in the
mid-twentieth century refined this to one part in $10^{12}$. These are generically referred to as E\"{o}tv\"{o}s experiments.\index{E\"{o}tv\"{o}s experiments}

Figure \figref{braginskii} shows a strategy for doing E\"{o}tv\"{o}s experiments that has proved successful.
The top panel is a simplified. The platform is balanced, so the gravitational
        masses of the two objects are observed to be equal. The objects are made of different substances. If the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass fails to hold
        for these two substances, then the force of gravity on each mass will not be exact proportion to its inertia, and the
        platform will experience a slight torque as the earth spins.
The bottom panel shows a more realistic drawing of an experiment by Braginskii and Panov.\footnote{V.B. Braginskii and V.I. Panov, Soviet Physics JETP 34, 463 (1972).}
                      The whole thing was encased in a tall vacuum tube, which was placed in a
                      sealed basement whose temperature was controlled to within 0.02\degcunit.
                      The total mass of the platinum and aluminum test masses, plus the tungsten
                      wire and the balance arms, was only 4.4 g. To detect tiny motions, a laser
                      beam was bounced off of a mirror attached to the wire. There was so little
                      friction that the balance would have taken on the order of several years
                      to calm down completely after being put in place; to stop these vibrations,
                      static electrical forces were applied through the two circular plates to provide
                      very gentle twists on the ellipsoidal mass between them.

One consequence of the E\"{o}tv\"{o}s experiments' null results is that it is not possible to tell the difference between an acceleration and
a gravitational field. At certain times during Betty's field trip, she feels herself pressed against her seat,
and she interprets this as evidence that she's in a space vessel that is undergoing violent accelerations
and decelerations. But it's equally possible that Tutorbot has simply arranged for her capsule to be hung
from a rope and dangled into the gravitational field of a planet at various times.
Suppose that the first
explanation is correct. The capsule is initially at rest in outer space, where there is no gravity.
Betty can release a pencil and a lead ball in the air inside the cabin, and they will stay in place.
The capsule then accelerates, and to Betty, who has adopted a frame of reference tied to its deck, ceiling
and walls, it appears that the pencil and the ball fall to the deck. They are guaranteed to stay side by
side until they hit the deckplates, because in fact they aren't accelerating; they simply appear to accelerate,
when in reality it's the deckplates that are coming up and hitting them.
But now consider the second explanation, that the capsule has been dipped into a gravitational field.
The ball and the pencil will still fall side by side to the floor, because they have the same ratio of
gravitational to inertial mass.

This leads to one way of stating a central principle of relativity known as the \emph{equivalence principle}:
Accelerations and gravitational fields are equivalent. There is no experiment that can distinguish one from
the other.\footnote{This statement of the equivalence principle is summarized,

To see what a radical departure this is, we need to compare with the completely different picture presented by
Newtonian physics and special relativity. Newton's law of inertia states that
``Every object perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a straight
line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed 
thereon.''\footnote{paraphrased from a translation by Motte, 1729}
Newton's intention here was to clearly state a contradiction of Aristotelian physics, in which objects
were supposed to naturally stop moving and come to rest in the absence of a force. For Aristotle, ``at rest''
meant at rest relative to the Earth, which represented a special frame of reference. But if motion doesn't
naturally stop of its own accord, then there is no longer any way to single out one frame of reference,
such as the one tied to the Earth, as being special. An equally good frame of reference is a
car driving in a straight line down the interstate at constant speed. The Earth and the car both represent
valid \emph{inertial} frames of reference,\index{inertial frame}\index{frame of reference!inertial}
in which Newton's law of inertia is valid. On the other hand, there are other, noninertial frames of reference,
in which the law of inertia is violated. For example, if the car decelerates suddenly, then it appears to the people
in the car as if their bodies are being jerked forward, even though there is no physical object that could be
exerting any type of forward force on them. This distinction between inertial and noninertial frames of reference
was carried over by Einstein into his theory of special relativity, published in 1905.

But by the time he published the general theory in 1915, Einstein had
realized that this distinction between inertial and noninertial frames of reference was fundamentally
suspect. How do we know that a particular frame of reference is inertial? One way is to verify that its motion
relative to some other inertial frame, such as the Earth's, is in a straight line and at constant speed.
But how does the whole process get started? We need to bootstrap the process with at least one frame of reference to
act as our standard. We can look for a frame in which the law of inertia is valid, but now we run into
another difficulty. To verify that the law of inertia holds, we have to check that an observer tied
to that frame doesn't see objects accelerating for no reason. The trouble here is that by the
equivalence principle, there is no way to determine whether the object is accelerating ``for no reason''
or because of a gravitational force. Betty, for example, cannot tell by any local measurement (i.e.,
any measurement carried out within the capsule) whether she is in an inertial or a noninertial frame.
<%

    'inertial-frame',
    %q{%
      Wouldn't it be nice if we could define the meaning of an inertial frame of reference? Newton makes it sound easy:
      to define an inertial frame,
      just find some object that is not accelerating because it is not being acted on by any external forces. But what object would we use?
      The earth? The ``fixed stars?'' Our galaxy? Our supercluster of galaxies? All of these are accelerating --- relative to something.

We could hope to resolve the ambiguity by making non-local measurements instead. For example, if Betty
had been allowed to look out a porthole, she could have tried to tell whether her capsule was
accelerating relative to the stars. Even this possibility ends up not being satisfactory. The stars
in our galaxy are moving in circular orbits around the galaxy. On an even larger scale, the universe
is expanding in the aftermath of the Big Bang. It spent about the first half of its history decelerating
due to gravitational attraction, but the expansion is now observed to be accelerating, apparently due
to a poorly understood phenomenon referred to by the catch-all term ``dark energy.''\index{dark energy}
In general, there is no distant background of physical objects in the universe that is not accelerating.

The conclusion is that we need to abandon the entire distinction between inertial and noninertial
frames of reference. The best that we can do is to single out certain frames of reference defined
by the motion of objects that are not subject to any nongravitational forces. A falling rock defines
such a frame of reference. In this frame, the rock is at rest, and the floor is accelerating.
The rock's world-line is a straight line of constant $x$ and varying $t$. Such a free-falling frame of reference
is called a Lorentz frame. The frame of reference defined by a rock sitting on a table is an inertial
frame of reference according to the Newtonian view, but it is not a Lorentz frame.

In Newtonian physics, inertial frames are preferable because they make motion simple: objects with no
forces acting on them move along straight world-lines. Similarly, Lorentz frames occupy a privileged position
in general relativity because they make motion simple: objects move along straight world-lines
if they have no nongravitational forces acting on them.

<% begin_sec("Locality of Lorentz frames") %>
It would be nice if we could define a single Lorentz frame that would cover the entire universe, but we can't.
In figure \figref{local-lorentz-frames}, two girls simultaneously drop down from tree branches --- one in Los
Angeles and one in Mumbai.
The girl free-falling in Los Angeles defines a Lorentz frame, and in that frame, other objects falling
nearby will also have straight world-lines. But in the LA girl's frame of reference, the girl falling in Mumbai
does not have a straight world-line: she is accelerating up toward the LA girl with an acceleration of about $2g$.

A second way of stating the equivalence principle is that it is always possible to define a \emph{local} Lorentz
frame in a particular neighborhood of spacetime.\footnote{This statement of the equivalence principle is summarized,
along with some other forms of it, in the back of the book on page
\pageref{equivalence-principle-summary}.}\index{equivalence principle!spacetime locally Lorentzian}\label{equivalence-locally-lorentzian}
It is not possible to do so on a universal basis.

The locality of Lorentz frames can be understood in the analogy of the string stretched across the globe.
We don't notice the curvature of the Earth's surface in everyday life because the radius of curvature
is thousands of kilometers. On a map of LA, we don't notice any curvature, nor do we detect it on a map
of Mumbai, but it is not possible to make a flat map that includes both LA and Mumbai without seeing
severe distortions.

Starting on page \pageref{gravity-affects-time}, we saw experimental evidence that the rate of flow of time
changes with height in a gravitational field. We can now see that this is required by the equivalence principle.

By the equivalence principle, there is no way to tell the difference between experimental results obtained in an
accelerating laboratory and those found in a laboratory immersed in a gravitational field. In a laboratory accelerating
upward, a photon emitted from the floor and would be Doppler-shifted toward lower frequencies when observed at the ceiling, because of the
change in the receiver's velocity during the photon's time of flight. The effect is given by $\Delta E/E=\Delta f/f=ay/c^2$, where
$a$ is the lab's acceleration, $y$ is the height from floor to ceiling, and $c$ is the speed of light.

Self-check: Verify this statement.

By the equivalence principle, we find that when such an experiment is done in a gravitational field $g$,\label{grav-redshift-by-ep}
there should be a gravitational effect on the energy of a photon equal to $\Delta E/E=gy/c^2$. Since the quantity $gy$ is
the gravitational energy per unit mass, the photon's fractional loss of energy is the same as the (Newtonian) loss of
energy experienced by a material object of mass $m$ and initial kinetic energy $mc^2$. 

The interpretation is as follows.
Classical electromagnetism requires that electromagnetic waves have inertia. For example, if a plane wave strikes
an ohmic surface, as in figure \figref{maxwellian-momentum-of-light}, the wave's electric field excites oscillating currents in the surface. These currents then
experience a magnetic force from the wave's magnetic field, and application of the right-hand rule shows that
the resulting force is in the direction of propagation of the wave. Thus the light wave acts as if it has momentum.
The equivalence principle says that whatever had inertia must also participate in gravitational interactions.
Therefore light waves must have weight, and the must lose energy when they rise through a gravitational field.

Self-check: Verify the application of the right-hand rule described above.

Further interpretation:
\begin{itemize}
\item  The quantity $mc^2$ is famous, even among people who don't know what $m$ and $c$ stand for. This
           is the first hint of where it comes from. The full story is given in section \ref{sec:momentum-four-vector}.
\item The relation $p=E/c$ between the energy and momentum of a light wave follows directly from Maxwell's equations,
           by the argument above; however, we will see in section \ref{sec:momentum-four-vector} that according
           to relativity this relation must hold for any massless
           particle
\item What we have found agrees with Niels Bohr's correspondence principle,\index{correspondence principle}
           which states that when a new physical theory, such as relativity, replaces an older one, such as
           Newtonian physics, the new theory must agree with the old one under the experimental conditions in
           which the old theory had been verified by experiments. The gravitational mass of a beam of light
           with energy $E$ is $E/c^2$, and since $c$ is a big number, it is not surprising that the weight of
           light rays had never been detected before.
\item This book describes one particular theory of gravity, Einstein's theory of general relativity. There are
           other theories of gravity, and some of these, such as the Brans-Dicke theory,\index{Brans-Dicke theory}
           do just as well as general relativity in agreeing with the presently available experimental data.
           Our prediction of gravitational Doppler shifts of light only depended on the equivalence principle,
           which is one ingredient of general relativity. Experimental tests of this prediction only
           test the equivalence principle; they do not allow us to distinguish between one theory of gravity
           and another if both theories incorporate the equivalence principle.

The 1959 Pound-Rebka experiment at Harvard\footnote{Phys. Rev. Lett. 4 (1960) 337} was the first quantitative test of this effect to be carried out
under controlled conditions, and in this section we will discuss it in detail.

When $y$ is on the order of magnitude of the height of a building, the value of $\Delta E/E=gy/c^2$ is $\sim 10^{-14}$, so
an extremely high precision experiment is necessary in order to detect a gravitational redshift. A number of other effects are big
enough to obscure it entirely, and must be eliminated or compensated for somehow. These are listed below, along with their
orders of magnitude in the experimental design finally settled on by Pound and Rebka.

(2) \emph{The recoil Doppler shift.\/} 
         When an atom emits a photon with energy $E$ and momentum $p=E/c$, conservation of momentum requires that the
         atom recoil with momentum $p=-E/c$ and energy $p^2/2m$. This causes a downward Doppler shift of the energy of the emitted photon.
         A similar effect occurs on absorption, doubling the problem.
       & $\sim 10^{-12}$ \\
(3) \emph{Natural line width.\/} The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that a state with a half-life $\tau$ must have
         an uncertainty in its energy of at least $\sim h/\tau$, where $h$ is Planck's constant.
       & $\sim10^{-12}$ \\
(4) \emph{Special-relativistic Doppler shift due to temperature.\/} Section \ref{sec:time-experiments} presented experimental
         evidence that time flows at a different rate depending on the motion of the observer. Therefore the thermal
         motion of an atom emitting a photon has an effect on the frequency of the photon, even if the atom's motion is
         not along the line of emission. The equations needed in order to calculate this effect will not be derived until
         section \ref{sec:lorentz-geometry}; a quantitative estimate is given in example \ref{eg:pound-rebka-time-dilation} on page \pageref{eg:pound-rebka-time-dilation}.
         For now, we only need to know that this leads to a temperature-dependence in
         the \emph{average} frequency of emission, in addition to the broadening of the bell curve described by (1) above.

The most straightforward way to mitigate effect (1) is to use photons emitted from a solid. At first glance
this would seem like a bad idea, since electrons in a solid emit a continuous spectrum of light, not a discrete
spectrum like the ones emitted by gases; this is because we have $N$ electrons, where $N$ is on the order of
Avogadro's number, all interacting strongly with one another,
so by the correspondence principle\index{correspondence principle} the discrete quantum-mechanical behavior
must be averaged out. But the protons and neutrons within one nucleus do not interact much at all with
those in other nuclei, so the photons emitted by a \emph{nucleus} do have a discrete spectrum. The energy scale
of nuclear excitations is in the keV or MeV range, so these photons are x-rays or gamma-rays. Furthermore,
the time-scale of the random vibrations of a nucleus in a solid are extremely short. For a velocity on the
order of 100 m/s, and vibrations with an amplitude of $\sim 10^{-10}\ \munit$, the time is about $10^{-12}\ \sunit$.
In many cases, this is much shorter than the half-life of the excited nuclear state emitting the gamma-ray, and
therefore the Doppler shift averages out to nearly zero.

           state just above the ground state, with an excitation energy of 14 keV and a half-life of $10^{-7}$ s. This state finally
           decays, either by gamma emission or emission of an internal conversion electron, to the ground state.}

Effect (2) is still much bigger than the $10^{-14}$ size of the effect to be measured. It can be avoided by exploiting
the M\"{o}ssbauer effect,\index{M\"{o}ssbauer effect} in which a nucleus in a solid substance at low temperature
emits or absorbs a gamma-ray photon, but with significant probability the recoil is
taken up not by the individual nucleus but by a vibration of the atomic lattice as a whole. Since the recoil energy
varies as $p^2/2m$, the large mass of the lattice leads to a very small dissipation of energy into the recoiling lattice.
Thus if a photon is emitted and absorbed by identical nuclei in a solid, and for both emission and absorption
the recoil momentum is taken up by the
lattice as a whole, then there is negligible recoil.
One must pick an isotope that emits photons with energies of about 10-100 keV.
X-rays with energies lower than about 10 keV tend to be absorbed strongly by matter
and are difficult to detect, whereas for gamma-ray energies $\gtrsim 100\ \zu{keV}$ the M\"{o}ssbauer effect is not
sufficient to eliminate the recoil effect completely enough.

If the experiment was carried out in a horizontal plane, then resonant absorption would occur. When the source and
absorber are aligned vertically, gravitational frequency shifts should cause a mismatch, destroying the resonance.
One can move the source at a small velocity (typically a few
mm/s) in order to add a Doppler shift onto the frequency; by determining the velocity that compensates for the
gravitational effect, one can determine how big the gravitational effect is.

The typical half-life for deexcitation of a nucleus by emission
of a gamma-ray with energy $E$ is in the nanosecond range. To measure an gravitational effect at the $10^{-14}$ level,
one would like to have a natural line width, (3), with $\Delta E/E \lesssim 10^{-14}$, which would require a half-life
of $\gtrsim 10\ \mu\sunit$. In practice, Pound and Rebka found that other effects, such as (4) and electron-nucleus
interactions that depended on the preparation of the sample, tended to put nuclei in one sample ``out of tune'' with those
in another sample at the $10^{-13}$-$10^{-12}$ level, so that resonance could not be achieved unless the natural line width
gave $\Delta E/E \gtrsim 10^{-12}$. As a result, they
settled on an experiment in which 14 keV gammas were emitted by $^{57}\zu{Fe}$ nuclei at the top of a 22-meter
tower, and absorbed by $^{57}\zu{Fe}$ nuclei at the bottom. The 100-ns half-life of the excited state leads to
$\Delta E/E \sim 10^{-12}$. This is 500 times greater than the gravitational effect to be measured, so, as described
in more detail below, the experiment
depended on high-precision measurements of small up-and-down shifts of the bell-shaped resonance curve.

The absorbers were seven iron films isotopically
enhanced in $^{57}\zu{Fe}$, applied directly to the faces of seven sodium-iodide scintillation detectors.
When a gamma-ray impinges on the absorbers, a number of different things can happen, of which we can get away with
considering only the following:
(a) the gamma-ray is resonantly absorbed in one of the $^{57}\zu{Fe}$ absorbers,
after which the excited nucleus decays by re-emission of another such photon (or a conversion electron), in a random direction;
(b) the gamma-ray passes through the absorber and then produces ionization directly in the sodium iodide crystal.
In case b, the gamma-ray is detected. In case a, there is a 50\% probability that the re-emitted photon will
come out in the upward direction, so that it cannot be detected. Thus when the conditions are right for resonance,
a reduction in count rate is expected. The M\"{o}ssbauer effect never occurs with 100\% probability;
in this experiment, about a third of the gammas incident on the absorbers were resonantly absorbed. 

The choice of $y=22$ m was dictated mainly by systematic errors. The experiment was limited by the strength of the
gamma-ray source. For a source of a fixed strength, the count rate in the detector at a distance $y$ would be
proportional to $y^{-2}$, leading to statistical errors proportional to $1/\sqrt{\text{count rate}}\propto y$.
Since the effect to be measured is also proportional to $y$, the signal-to-noise ratio was independent of $y$.
However, systematic effects such as (4) were easier to monitor and account for when $y$ was fairly large.
A lab building at Harvard happened to have a 22-meter tower, which was used for the experiment.
To reduce the absorption of the gammas in the 22 meters of air, a long, cylindrical mylar bag full of helium
gas was placed in the shaft.

The resonance was a bell-shaped curve with a minimum at the natural frequency of emission. Since the curve
was at a minimum, where its derivative was zero, the sensitivity of the count rate to the gravitational shift would have
been nearly zero if the source had been stationary. Therefore it was necessary to vibrate the source up and down, so that the emitted photons would be Doppler shifted
onto the shoulder of the resonance curve, where the slope of the curve was large. The resulting asymmetry in count rates
is shown in figure \figref{pound-rebka-v-t}. A further effort to cancel out possible systematic effects was made by frequently
swapping the source and absorber between the top and bottom of the tower.

For $y=22.6\ \munit$, the equivalence principle predicts a fractional frequency shift due to gravity of $2.46\times10^{-15}$.
Pound and Rebka measured the shift to be $(2.56\pm 0.25)\times10^{-15}$.
% The values P&R give are 4.92 and 5.13+-.51, which are the doubled frequency shifts
The results were in statistical agreement with
theory, and verified the predicted size of the effect to a precision of 10\%.

The geometrical treatment of space, time, and gravity only requires as its basis the equivalence of
inertial and gravitational mass. That equivalence holds for Newtonian gravity, so it is indeed possible
to redo Newtonian gravity as a theory of curved spacetime. This project was carried out by the French mathematician
Cartan,\index{Cartan!curved-spacetime theory of Newtonian gravity}\label{cartan-newtonian}
as summarized very readably in section 17.5 of \emph{The Road to Reality} by Roger Penrose.
The geometry of the local reference frames is very simple.
The three space dimensions have an approximately Euclidean geometry, and the time dimension is
entirely separate from them. This is referred to as a Euclidean spacetime with 3+1 dimensions.
Although the outlook is
radically different from Newton's, all of the predictions of experimental results are the same.

The experiments in section \ref{sec:time-experiments} show, however, that there are real, experimentally verifiable
violations of Newton's laws. In Newtonian physics, time is supposed to flow at the same rate everywhere, which
we have found to be false. 
The flow of time is actually dependent on the observer's state of motion through space, which shows that the space
and time dimensions are intertwined somehow. 
The geometry of the local frames
in relativity therefore must not be as simple as Euclidean 3+1. Their actual geometry was implicit in Einstein's
1905 paper on special relativity, and had already been developed mathematically, without the
full physical interpretation, by Hendrik Lorentz. Lorentz's and Einstein's work were explicitly connected
by Minkowski in 1907, so a Lorentz frame is often referred to as a Minkowski frame.\index{Minkowski}

To describe this Lorentz geometry, we need to add
more structure on top of the axioms O1-O4 of ordered geometry, but it will not be the additional
Euclidean structure of E3-E4, it will be something different.

To see how to proceed, let's consider the bare minimum of geometrical apparatus that would be necessary
in order to set up frames of reference. The following argument shows that the main missing ingredient is merely
a concept of parallelism.
We only expect Lorentz frames to be local, but we do need them
to be big enough to cover at least some amount of spacetime. If Betty does an E\"{o}tv\"{o}s experiment
by releasing a pencil and a lead ball side by side, she is essentially trying to release them at the same
event A, so that she can observe them later and determine whether their world-lines stay right on top
of one another at point B. That was all that was required for the E\"{o}tv\"{o}s experiment, but in order
to set up a Lorentz frame we need to start dealing with objects that are not right on top of one another.
Suppose we release two lead balls in two different locations, at rest relative to one another. This could be the first step toward
adding measurement to our geometry, since the balls mark two points in space that are separated by
a certain distance, like two marks on a ruler, or the goals at the ends of a soccer field.
Although the balls are separated by some finite distance, they are still close enough
together so that if there is a gravitational field in the area, it is very nearly the same in both
locations, and we expect the distance defined by the gap between them to stay the same.
Since they are both subject only to gravitational forces, their world-lines are (by definition)
straight lines (geodesics). The goal here is to end up with some kind of coordinate grid
defining a $(t,x)$ plane, and on such a grid, the two balls' world-lines are vertical lines.
If we release them at events P and Q, then observe them again later at R and S, PQRS should
form a rectangle on such a plot. In the figure, the irregularly spaced tick marks along the
edges of the rectangle are meant to suggest that although ordered geometry provides us with
a well-defined ordering along these lines, we have not yet constructed a complete system of measurement.

  fig(
    'parallel-moving',
    %q{There is no well-define angular measure in this geometry. In a different frame of reference, the angles are not right angles.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

The depiction of PQSR as a rectangle, with right angles at its vertices, might lead us to believe that our geometry would
have something like the concept of angular measure referred to in Euclid's E4, equality of right angles.
But this is too naive even for the Euclidean 3+1 spacetime of Newton and Galileo.
Suppose we switch to a frame that is moving relative to the first one, so that the balls
are not at rest. In the Euclidean spacetime, time is absolute, so events P and Q
would remain simultaneous, and so would R and S; the
top and bottom edges PQ and RS would remain horizontal on the plot, but the balls' world-lines
PR and QS would become slanted. The result would be a parallelogram. Since observers in different
states of motion do not agree on what constitutes a right angle, the concept of angular measure
is clearly not going to be useful here. Similarly, if Euclid had observed that a right angle
drawn on a piece of paper no longer appeared to be a right angle when the paper was turned around,
he would never have decided that angular measure was important enough to be enshrined in E4.

In the context of relativity, where time is not absolute, there is not even any reason to believe that different observers
must agree on the simultaneity of PQ and RS. Our observation that time flows differently depending
on the observer's state of motion tells us specifically to expect this \emph{not} to happen when we
switch to a frame moving to the relative one. Thus in general we expect that PQRS will be distorted
into a form like the one shown in the third panel of the figure. We do expect, however, that it will
remain a parallelogram; a Lorentz frame is one in which the gravitational field, if any, is constant, so
the properties of spacetime are uniform, and by symmetry the new frame should still have PR=QS and PQ=RS.

With this motivation, we form the system of \emph{affine geometry}\index{affine geometry} by adding the following axioms
to set O1-O4.\footnote{The axioms are summarized for convenient reference in the back of the book on page
\pageref{affine-summary}. This formulation is essentially the one given by Penrose, \emph{The Road to Reality}, in section 14.1.}\label{affine-axioms}
The notation [PQRS] means that events P, Q, S, and R form a parallelogram, and is defined
as the statement that the lines determined by PQ and RS never meet at a point, and similarly for PR and QS.

\begin{itemize}
\item[A1] Constructibility of parallelograms: Given any P, Q, and R, there exists S such that [PQRS], and if P, Q, and R are distinct then S is unique.
\item[A2] Symmetric treatment of the sides of a parallelogram: If [PQRS], then [QRSP], [QPSR], and [PRQS].
\item[A3] Lines parallel to the same line are parallel to one another: If [ABCD] and [ABEF], then [CDEF].
\end{itemize}

The following theorem is a stronger version of Playfair's axiom E5, the interpretation being that affine geometry
describes a spacetime that is locally flat.

Theorem: Given any line $\ell$ and any point P not on the line, there exists a unique line through P that is parallel
to $\ell$.

This is stronger than E5, which only guarantees uniqueness, not existence.
Informally, the idea here is that A1 guarantees the existence of the parallel, and A3 makes it unique.\footnote{
Proof: Pick any two distinct points A and B on $\ell$, and construct the uniquely determined parallelogram [ABPQ] (axiom A1).
Points P and Q determine a line (axiom O1), and this line is parallel to $\ell$ (definition of the parallelogram).
To prove that this line is unique, we argue by contradiction. Suppose some other parallel $m$ to exist.
If $m$ crosses the infinite line BQ at some point Z, then both [ABPQ] and [ABPZ], so by A1, Q=Z, so the
$\ell$ and $m$ are the same. The only other possibility is that $m$ is parallel to BQ, but then the following
chain of parallelisms holds: PQ $\parallel$ AB $\parallel$ $m$ $\parallel$ BQ. By A3, lines parallel to another
line are parallel to each other, so PQ $\parallel$ BQ, but this is a contradiction, since they have Q in common.}

Although these new axioms do nothing more than to introduce the concept of parallelism lacking in ordered
geometry, it turns out that they also allow us to build up a concept of measurement. Let $\ell$ be
a line, and suppose we want to define a number system on this line that measures how far apart events are.
Depending on the type of line, this could be a measurement of time, of spatial distance, or a mixture of the
two. First we arbitrarily single out two distinct points on $\ell$ and label them 0 and 1. Next, pick some
auxiliary point $\zu{q}_0$ not lying on $\ell$. By A1, construct the parallelogram $01\zu{q}_0\zu{q}_1$.
Next construct $\zu{q}_01\zu{q}_12$. Continuing in this way, we have a scaffolding of parallelograms adjacent
to the line, determining an infinite lattice of points 1, 2, 3, \ldots on the line, which
represent the positive integers. Fractions can be defined in a similar way. For example, $\frac{1}{2}$ is defined
as the the point such that when the initial lattice segment $0\frac{1}{2}$ is extended by the same construction, the next point
on the lattice is 1.

<%
  fig(
    'lattice-construction',
    %q{Construction of an affine parameter.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

The continuously varying variable constructed in this way is called an \emph{affine parameter}.\index{affine parameter}
The time measured by a free-falling clock is an example of an affine parameter, as is the distance measured
by the tick marks on a free-falling ruler. Since light rays travel along geodesics, the wave crests on a light wave
can even be used analogously to the ruler's tick marks.

\begin{eg}{Centroids}
The affine parameter can be used to define the centroid of a set of points. In the simplest
example, finding the centroid of two points, we simply bisect the line segment as described above in the
construction of the number  $\frac{1}{2}$. Similarly, the centroid of a triangle can be defined as the
intersection of its three medians, the lines joining each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
\end{eg}
<% marg(10) %>
<%
  fig(
    'centroid',
    %q{Affine geometry gives a well-defined centroid for the triangle.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

\begin{eg}{Conservation of momentum}
In nonrelativistic mechanics, the concept of the center of mass is closely related to the law of conservation
of momentum. For example, a logically complete statement of the law is that
if a system of particles is not subjected to any external force, and we pick a frame in which its center
of mass is initially at rest, then its center of mass remains at rest in that frame. Since centroids 
are well defined in affine geometry, and Lorentz frames have affine properties,
we have grounds to hope that it might be possible to generalize the definition of
momentum relativistically so that the generalized version is conserved in a Lorentz frame. 
On the other hand, we don't expect to be able to define anything like a global Lorentz frame
for the entire universe, so there is no such natural expectation of being able to define
a global principle of conservation of momentum. This is an example of a general fact about relativity,
which is that conservation laws are difficult or impossible to formulate globally.
\end{eg}

Although the affine parameter gives us a system of measurement for free in a geometry
whose axioms do not even explicitly mention measurement, there are some restrictions:

\begin{itemize}
\item[] The affine parameter is defined only along straight lines, i.e., geodesics. Alice's clock defines an affine parameter,
but Betty's does not, since it is subject to nongravitational forces.
\item[] We cannot compare distances along two arbitrarily chosen lines, only along a single line or two parallel lines.
\item[] The affine parameter is arbitrary not only in the choice of its origin 0 (which is to be expected in
any case, since any frame of reference requires such an arbitrary choice) but also in the choice of scale.
For example, there is no fundamental way of deciding how fast to make a clock tick.
\end{itemize}

We will eventually want to lift some of these restrictions by adding to our kit a tool called a metric, which
allows us to define distances along arbitrary curves in space time, and to compare distances in different directions.
The affine parameter, however, will not be entirely superseded. In particular, we'll find that the metric
has a couple of properties that are not as nice as those of the affine parameter. The square of a metric
distance can be negative, and the metric distance measured along a light ray is precisely zero, which is
not very useful.

Self-check: By the construction of the affine parameter above, affine distances
on the same line are comparable. By another construction, verify the claim made above that this can be
extended to distances measured along two different parallel lines.

\begin{eg}{Area and volume}\label{eg:affine-area-lattice}
It is possible to define area and volume in affine geometry. This is a little surprising,
since distances along different lines are not even comparable. However, we are already accustomed to multiplying
and dividing numbers that have different units (a concept that would have given Euclid conniptions), and the
situation in affine geometry is really no different. To define area, we extend the one-dimensional lattice
to two dimensions. Any planar figure can be superimposed on such a lattice, and dissected into parallelograms,
each of which has a standard area.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Area on a graph of v versus t}\label{eg:affine-area}
If an object moves at a constant velocity v for time t, the distance it travels can be represented by the
area of a parallelogram in an affine plane with sides having lengths v and t. These two lengths are measured by affine parameters
along two different directions, so they are not comparable. For example, it is meaningless to ask whether 1 m/s is greater
than, less than, or equal to 1 s. If we were graphing velocity as a function of time on a conventional Cartesian graph,
the v and t axes would be perpendicular, but affine geometry has no notion of angular measure, so this is irrelevant here.

<% begin_sec("Relativistic properties of Lorentz geometry") %>\label{sec:lorentz-geometry}

We now want to pin down the properties of the Lorentz geometry that are left unspecified by the affine treatment.
This can approached either by looking for an appropriate metric, or by finding the appropriate rules for
distorting parallelograms when switching from one frame of reference to another frame is in motion relative
to the first. In either case, we need some further input from experiments in order to show us how to proceed.
We take the following as empirical facts about flat spacetime:\footnote{These facts are summarized
for convenience on page \pageref{lorentz-summary} in the back of the book.}

\begin{itemize}\label{lorentz-geometry-postulates}
\item[L1] \emph{Spacetime is homogeneous and isotropic.} No point has special properties that make it distinguishable from other points, nor is one
                  direction distinguishable from another.
\item[L2] \emph{Inertial frames of reference exist.} These are frames in which particles move at constant velocity if not subject to any forces.
                  We can construct such a frame by using a particular particle, which is not subject to any forces, as a reference point.
\item[L3] \emph{Equivalence of inertial frames:} If a frame is in constant-velocity translational motion relative to an inertial frame, then it is also an inertial frame.
              No experiment can distinguish one inertial frame from another.
\item[L4] \emph{Causality:} Observers in different inertial frames agree on the time-ordering of events.
\item[L5] \emph{No simultaneity:} The experimental evidence in section \ref{sec:time-experiments} shows that
           observers in different inertial frames do not agree on the simultaneity of events.
\end{itemize}

Define affine parameters $t$ and $x$ for time and position, and construct a $(t,x)$ plane. Although
affine geometry treats all directions symmetrically, we're going beyond the affine aspects of
the space, and $t$ does play a different role than $x$
here, as shown, for example, by L4 and L5.

In the $(t,x)$ plane, consider a rectangle with one corner at the origin O. We can imagine its right and left edges
as representing the world-lines of two objects that are both initially at rest in this frame;
they remain at rest (L2), so the right and left edges are parallel.

We now define a second frame of reference such that the origins of the two frames coincide, but they
are in motion relative to one another with velocity $v$. The transformation $L$ from the first frame to
the second is referred to as a Lorentz boost
with velocity $v$.\index{boost}\index{Lorentz boost} $L$ depends on $v$.

By homogeneity of spacetime (L1), $L$ must be linear, so the original rectangle will be
transformed into a parallelogram in the new frame; this is also consistent with L3, which requires that the
world-lines on the right and left edges remain parallel. The left edge has inverse slope $v$.
By L5 (no simultaneity), the top and bottom edges are no longer horizontal.

  fig(
    'lorentz-boosted-rectangle',
    %q{Two objects at rest have world-lines that define a rectangle. In a second frame of reference in motion
        relative to the first one, the rectangle becomes a parallelogram.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

For simplicity, let the original rectangle have unit area. Then the area of the new parallelogram is 
still 1, by the following argument. Let the new area be $A$, which is a function of $v$.
By isotropy of spacetime (L1), $A(v)=A(-v)$.
Furthermore, the function $A(v)$ must have some universal form for all geometrical figures, not just
for a figure that is initially a particular rectangle; this follows because of our definition of affine area in terms
of a dissection by a two-dimensional lattice, which we can choose to be a lattice of squares.
Applying boosts $+v$ and $-v$ one after another results in a transformation back into our original
frame of reference, and since $A$ is universal for all shapes, it doesn't matter that the second
transformation starts from a parallelogram rather than a square. Scaling the area once by $A(v)$
and again by $A(-v)$ must therefore give back the original square with its original unit area,
$A(v)A(-v)=1$, and since $A(v)=A(-v)$, $A(v)=\pm1$ for any value of $v$. Since $A(0)=1$, we must
have $A(v)=1$ for all $v$. The argument is independent of the shape of the region, so we conclude
that all areas are preserved by Lorentz boosts. The argument is also purely one about affine
geometry (it would apply equally well to a Euclidean space), so there is no reason to expect the area
$A$ in the $(t,x)$ plane to have any special physical significance in relativity; it is simply a useful
mathematical tool in the present discussion.

If we consider a boost by an infinitesimal velocity $\der v$, then the vanishing change in area comes
from the sum of the areas of the four infinitesimally thin slivers where the rectangle lies either
outside the parallelogram (call this negative area) or inside it (positive). (We don't worry about
what happens near the corners, because such effects are of order $\der v^2$.) In other words, area flows
around in the $x-t$ plane, and the flows in and out of the rectangle must cancel. Let $v$ be positive;
the flow at the sides of the rectangle is then to the right. The flows through the top and bottom
cannot be in opposite directions (one up, one down) while maintaining the parallelism of the opposite
sides, so we have the following three possible cases:
<%
  fig(
    'lorentz-boost-area-flow-cases',
    %q{%
      Flows of area: (I) a shear that preserves simultaneity, (II) a rotation, (III) upward flow at all edges.
    },
    {
      'width'=>'wide',
      'sidecaption'=>true
    }
  )
%>

\begin{itemize}
\item[I] There is no flow through the top and bottom. This case corresponds to Galilean relativity, in which the rectangle shears horizontally under a boost,
  and simultaneity is preserved, violating L5.
\item[II] Area flows downward at both the top and the bottom. The flow is clockwise at both the positive $t$ axis and the positive $x$ axis.
  This makes it plausible that the flow is clockwise everywhere in the
  $(t,x)$ plane, and the proof is straightforward.\footnote{Proof: By linearity of $L$, the flow is clockwise at the negative axes as well.
  Also by linearity, the handedness of the flow is the same at all points on a ray extending
  out from the origin in the direction $\theta$. If the flow were
  counterclockwise somewhere, then it would have to switch handedness twice in that quadrant, at $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$. But by writing out
  the vector cross product $\vc{r}\times\der\vc{r}$, where $\der\vc{r}$ is the displacement caused by $L(\der v)$, we find that it
  depends on $\sin(2\theta+\delta)$, which does not oscillate rapidly enough to have two zeroes in the same quadrant.}
  As $v$ increases, a particular element of area flows continually clockwise.
  This violates L4, because two events with a cause and effect
  relationship could be time-reversed by a Lorentz boost.
\item[III] Area flows upward at both the top and the bottom.
\end{itemize}

Only case III is possible, and given case III, there must be at least one
point P in the first quadrant where area flows neither clockwise nor
counterclockwise.\footnote{This follows from the fact that, as shown in the preceding footnote, the handedness of the flow
depends only on $\theta$.}
The boost simply increases P's distance from
the origin by some factor.
By the linearity of the transformation, the entire line running through O and P is simply rescaled. This
special line's inverse slope, which has units of velocity, apparently has some special significance, so we give it a name,
$c$. We'll see later that $c$ is the maximum speed of cause and effect whose existence we inferred
in section \ref{sec:max-speed-of-cause-and-effect}. Any world-line with
a velocity equal to $c$ retains the same velocity as judged by moving observers, and by isotropy the same must
be true for $-c$.

For convenience, let's adopt time and space units in which $c=1$, and let the original rectangle be a unit square.
The upper right tip
of the parallelogram must slide along the line through the origin with slope $+1$, and similarly
the parallelogram's other diagonal must have a slope of $-1$. Since these diagonals bisected one
another on the original square, and since bisection is an affine property that is preserved when
we change frames of reference, the parallelogram must be equilateral.

We can now determine the complete form of the Lorentz transformation. Let unit square PQRS,
as described above, be transformed to parallelogram $\zu{P}'\zu{Q}'\zu{R}'\zu{S}'$ in the new coordinate system
$(x',t')$. Let the $t'$ coordinate of $\zu{R}'$ be $\gamma$, interpreted as the ratio between
the time elapsed on a clock moving from $\zu{P}'$ to $\zu{R}'$ and the corresponding time as measured by
a clock that is at rest in the $(x',t')$ frame. By the definition of $v$, $\zu{R}'$ has coordinates $(v\gamma,\gamma)$, and
the other geometrical facts established above place $\zu{Q}'$ symmetrically on
the other side of the diagonal, at $(\gamma,v\gamma)$. Computing the cross product of vectors
$\zu{P}'\zu{R}'$ and $\zu{P}'\zu{Q}'$, we find the area of $\zu{P}'\zu{Q}'\zu{R}'\zu{S}'$ to be $\gamma^2(1-v^2)$, and setting this equal
to 1 gives
\begin{equation*}
  \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2}} \qquad .
\end{equation*}

The result for the transformation $L$, a Lorentz boost along the $x$ axis with velocity $v$, is:
\begin{align*}
  t' &= \gamma t + v \gamma x \\
  x' &= v \gamma t + \gamma x
\end{align*}

The symmetry of $\zu{P}'\zu{Q}'\zu{R}'\zu{S}'$ with respect to reflection across the diagonal indicates that
the time and space dimensions are treated symmetrically, although they are not entirely
interchangeable as they would have been in case II.
Although we defined $\gamma$ in terms of the time coordinate of $\zu{R}'$, we could just as easily have used the spatial
coordinate of $\zu{Q}'$, so $\gamma$ represents a factor of both time dilation and length contraction.
(Clearly it wouldn't have made sense to distort one quantity without distorting the other, since the invariant
velocity $c$ represents a ratio of a distance to a time.) In summary, a clock runs fastest according to an observer
who is at rest relative to the clock, and a measuring rod likewise appears longest in its own rest frame.

The lack of a universal notion of simultaneity has a similarly symmetric interpretation. In prerelativistic
physics, points in space have no fixed identity. A brass plaque commemorating a Civil War battle is not
at the same location as the battle, according to an observer who perceives the Earth has having been hurtling
through space for the intervening centuries. By symmetry, points in time have no fixed identity either.

In everyday life, we don't notice relativistic effects like time dilation, so apparently $\gamma\approx1$,
and $v \ll 1$, i.e., the speed $c$ must be very large when expressed in meters per second. By setting $c$ equal
to 1, we have chosen a the distance unit that is extremely long in proportion to the time unit.
This is an example of the correspondence principle,\index{correspondence principle}
which states that when a new physical theory, such as relativity, replaces an old one, such as Galilean relativity, it must remain
``backward-compatible'' with all the experiments that verified the old theory; that is, it must agree with the old
theory in the appropriate limit. Despite my coyness, you probably know that the speed of light is also
equal to $c$. It is important to emphasize, however, that light plays no special role in relativity, nor was
it necessary to assume the constancy of the speed of light in order to derive the Lorentz transformation; we will
in fact prove on page \pageref{c-is-speed-of-light} that photons must travel at $c$, and on page
\pageref{c-is-speed-of-massless-particles} that this must be true for any massless particle.

\begin{eg}{}\label{eg:lorentz-boost-diagonals}
Let the intersection of the parallelogram's two diagonals be T in the original (rest) frame, and $\zu{T}'$
in the Lorentz-boosted frame. An observer at T in the original frame simultaneously detects the passing by of the
two flashes of light emitted at $\zu{P}$ and $\zu{Q}$, and since she is positioned at the midpoint of the diagram
in space, she infers that $\zu{P}$ and $\zu{Q}$ were simultaneous. Since the arrival of both flashes of light
at the same point in spacetime is a concrete event, an observer in the Lorentz-boosted frame must agree on their
simultaneous arrival. (Simultaneity \emph{is} well defined as long as no spatial separation is involved.)
But the distances traveled by the two flashes in the boosted frame are unequal, and since the speed of light is
the same in all cases, the boosted observer infers that they were not emitted simultaneously.

A different kind of symmetry is the symmetry between observers. If observer A says observer B's
time is slow, shouldn't B say that A's time is fast? This is what would happen if B took a pill that slowed
down all his thought processes: to him, the rest of the world would seem faster than normal. But this can't
be correct for Lorentz boosts, because it would introduce an asymmetry between observers. There is no
preferred, ``correct'' frame corresponding to the observer who didn't take a pill; either observer can
correctly consider himself to be the one who is at rest. It may seem paradoxical that each observer could
think that the other was the slow one, but the paradox evaporates when we consider the methods available
to A and B for resolving the controversy. They can either (1) send signals back and forth, or (2)
get together and compare clocks in person. Signaling doesn't establish one observer as correct and one as
incorrect, because as we'll see
in the following section, there is a limit to the speed of propagation of signals; either observer ends
up being able to explain the other observer's observations by taking into account the finite and
changing time required for signals to propagate. Meeting in person requires one or both observers
to accelerate, as in the original story of Alice and Betty, and then we are no longer dealing with
pure Lorentz frames, which are described by non-accelerating observers.

\begin{eg}{GPS}\label{eg:gps}
In the Hafele-Keating experiment using atomic clocks aboard airplanes (\pageref{sec:hafele-keating}), both gravity and motion had
effects on the rate of flow of time. Similarly, both effects must be considered in the case of the GPS system.
The gravitational effect was found on page \pageref{grav-redshift-by-ep} to be $\Delta E/E=gy$ (with $c=1$), based on the
equivalence principle. The special-relativistic effect can be found from the Lorentz transformation.
Let's determine the directions and relative strengths of the two effects in the case of a GPS satellite.

A radio photon emitted by a GPS satellite gains energy as it falls to the earth's surface, so its energy
and frequency are increased by this effect. The observer on the ground, after accounting for all non-relativistic effects
such as Doppler shifts and the Sagnac effect, would interpret the frequency shift by saying that time aboard
the satellite was flowing more quickly than on the ground.

However, the satellite is also moving at orbital speeds, so there is a Lorentz time dilation effect. According
to the observer on earth, this causes time aboard the satellite to flow more slowly than on the ground.

We can therefore see that the two effects are of opposite sign. Which is stronger?

For a satellite in low earth orbit, we would have $v^2/r=g$, where $r$ is only slightly greater than the radius of the earth.
Expanding the Lorentz gamma factor in a Taylor series, we find that the relative effect on the flow of time
is $\gamma-1\approx v^2/2 = gr/2$. The gravitational effect, approximating
$g$ as a constant, is $-gy$, where $y$ is the satellite's altitude above the earth. For such a satellite,
the gravitational effect is down by a factor of $2y/r$, so the Lorentz time dilation dominates.

GPS satellites, however, are not in low earth orbit. They orbit at an altitude of about 20,200 km, which is quite a bit
greater than the radius of the earth. We therefore expect the gravitational effect to dominate. To confirm this,
we need to generalize the equation $\Delta E/E=gy$ to the case where $g$ is not a constant.
Integrating the equation $\der E/E = g \der y$, we find that the time dilation factor is equal to $e^{\Delta\Phi}$, where
$\Phi=\int g\der y$ is the gravitational potential per unit mass. When $\Delta\Phi$ is small, this causes a relative effect
equal to $\Delta\Phi$. The total effect for a GPS satellite is thus
(inserting factors of $c$ for calculation with SI units, and using positive signs for blueshifts)
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{1}{c^2}\left(+\Delta\Phi-\frac{v^2}{2}\right) = 5.2\times10^{-10} - 0.9\times10^{-10} \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
where the first term is gravitational and the second kinematic. A more detailed analysis includes various time-varying
effects, but this is the constant part. For this reason, the atomic clocks aboard the satellites are set to
a frequency of 10.22999999543 MHz before launching them into orbit; on the average, this is perceived on the
ground as 10.23 MHz. A more complete analysis of the general relativity involved in the GPS system can be found
in the review article by Ashby.\footnote{N. Ashby, ``Relativity in the Global Positioning System,'' \url{http://www.livingreviews.org/lrr-2003-1}}

\begin{eg}{Time dilation in the Pound-Rebka experiment}\label{eg:pound-rebka-time-dilation}
In the description of the Pound-Rebka experiment on page \pageref{sec:pound-rebka}, I postponed
the quantitative estimation of the frequency shift due to temperature. Classically, one expects only
a \emph{broadening} of the line, since the Doppler shift is proportional to $v_\parallel/c$, where
$v_\parallel$, the component of the emitting atom's velocity along the line of sight, averages to zero.
But relativity tells us to expect that if the emitting atom is moving, its time will flow more slowly,
so the frequency of the light it emits will also be systematically shifted downward. This frequency shift should increase
with temperature. In other words, the Pound-Rebka experiment was designed as a test of general relativity (the equivalence
principle), but this special-relativistic effect is just as strong as the relativistic one, and needed to be accounted
for carefully.

In Pound and Rebka's paper describing their experiment,\footnote{Phys. Rev. Lett. 4 (1960) 337}
they refer to a preliminary measurement\footnote{Phys. Rev. Lett. 4 (1960) 274}
in which they carefully measured this effect, showed that it was consistent with theory,
and pointed out that a previous claim by Cranshaw et al. of having measured the gravitational
frequency shift was vitiated by their failure to control for the temperature dependence.

It turns out that the full Debye treatment of the lattice vibrations is not really necessary
near room temperature, so we'll simplify the thermodynamics. At absolute temperature $T$,
the mean translational kinetic energy of each iron nucleus is $(3/2)kT$. The velocity is much less
than $c(=1)$, so we can use the nonrelativistic expression for kinetic energy,
$K=(1/2)mv^2$, which gives a mean value for $v^2$ of $3kT/m$. In the limit of $v \ll 1$,
time dilation produces a change in frequency by a factor of $1/\gamma$, which differs from unity by approximately $-v^2/2$.
The relative time dilation is therefore $-3kT/2m$, or, in metric units, $-3kT/2mc^2$. The vertical scale on the graph contains
an arbitrary offset, since Pound and Rebka's measurements were the best absolute measurements to date of the frequency.
The predicted slope of $-3k/2mc^2$, however, is not arbitrary. Plugging in 57 atomic mass units for $m$, we find
the slope to be $2.4\times10^{-15}$, which, as shown in the figure is an excellent approximation (off by only
10\%) near room temperature.

<% begin_sec("The light cone") %>

Given an event P, we can now classify all the causal relationships in which P can participate.
In Newtonian physics, these relationships fell into two classes: P could potentially cause any event
that lay in its future, and could have been caused by any event in its past.
In a Lorentzian spacetime, we have a trichotomy rather than a dichotomy. There is a third class
of events that are too far away from P in space, and too close in time, to allow any cause and effect
relationship, since causality's maximum velocity is $c$. Since we're working in units in which $c=1$,
the boundary of this set is formed by the lines with slope $\pm1$ on a $(t,x)$ plot. This is referred
to as the light cone,\index{light cone} and in the generalization from 1+1 to 3+1 dimensions, it literally
becomes a (four-dimensional) cone. The terminology comes from the fact that light happens to travel at $c$,
the maximum speed of cause and effect. If we make a cut through the cone defined by a surface of constant time
in P's future, the resulting section is a sphere (analogous to the circle formed by cutting a three-dimensional
cone), and this sphere is interpreted as the set of events on which P could have had a causal effect by
radiating a light pulse outward in all directions.

Events lying inside one another's light cones are said to have a timelike relationship. Events outside each
other's light cones are spacelike in relation to one another, and in the case where they lie on the surfaces
of each other's light cones the term is lightlike.\index{spacelike}\index{timelike}\index{lightlike}

The light cone plays the same role in the Lorentzian geometry that the circle plays in Euclidean geometry.
The truth or falsehood of propositions in Euclidean geometry remains the same regardless of how we rotate
the figures, and this is expressed by Euclid's E3 asserting the existence of circles, which remain
invariant under rotation. Similarly, Lorentz boosts preserve light cones and truth of propositions
in a Lorentz frame.

Self-check: Under what circumstances is the time-ordering of events P and Q preserved under a Lorentz boost?

In a uniform Lorentzian spacetime, all the
light cones line up like soldiers with their axes parallel with one another. When gravity is present, however,
this uniformity is disturbed in the vicinity of the masses that constitute the sources.
The light cones lying near the sources tip toward the sources. Superimposed on top of this
gravitational tipping together, recent observations have demonstrated a systematic tipping-apart
effect which becomes significant on cosmological distance scales. The parameter $\Lambda$ that sets
the strength of this effect is known as the cosmological constant.\index{cosmological constant}
The cosmological constant is not related to the presence of any sources (such as negative masses),
and can be interpreted instead as a tendency for space to expand over time on its own initiative.
In the present era, the cosmological constant has overpowered the gravitation of the universe's
mass, causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate.

\begin{eg}{A Newtonian black hole}\label{eg:newtonian-black-hole}
In the case of a black hole, the light cone tips over so far that the entire future timelike
region lies within the black hole. If an observer is present at such an event, then that observer's
entire potential future lies within the black hole, not outside it.
By expanding on the logical consequences of this statement, we arrive at an example of
relativity's proper interpretation as a theory of causality, not a theory of objects exerting forces on one another
as in Newton's vision of action at a distance, or Lorentz's original ether-drag interpretation of the factor $\gamma$,
in which length contraction arose from a physical strain imposed on the atoms composing a physical body.

%>
<% end_marg %>

Imagine a black hole from a Newtonian point of view, as proposed in 1783 by
geologist John Michell. Setting the escape velocity equal to the speed of
light, we find that this will occur for any gravitating spherical body compact enough to have $M/r>c^2/2G$.
(A fully relativistic argument, as given in section \ref{sec:schwarzschild}, agrees on $M/r \propto c^2/G$, which is fixed by units. The correct unitless factor depends
on the definition of $r$, which is flexible in general relativity.)
A flash of light emitted from the surface of such a Newtonian black hole would fall back down like water from
a fountain, but it would nevertheless be possible for physical objects to escape, e.g., if they were lifted
out in a bucket dangling from a cable. If the cable is to support its own weight, it must have a tensile strength per unit density of at least
$c^2/2$, which is about ten orders of magnitude greater than that of carbon nanotube fibers. (The factor of $1/2$ is not to be
taken seriously, since it comes from a nonrelativistic calculation.)
The cause-and-effect interpretation of relativity tells
us that this is incorrect. A physical object that approaches to within a distance $r$ of a concentration of
mass $M$, with $M/r$ sufficiently large, has no causal future lying at larger values of $r$. The conclusion
is that there is a limit on the tensile strength of any substance, imposed purely by general relativity, and we
can state this limit without having to know anything about the physical nature of the interatomic forces.

<% begin_sec("Velocity addition") %>\label{sec:velocity-addition}
In classical physics, velocities add in relative motion. For example, if a boat moves relative to
a river, and the river moves relative to the land, then the boat's velocity relative to the land
is found by vector addition. This linear behavior cannot hold relativistically. For example,
if a spaceship is moving at $0.60c$ relative to the earth, and it launches a probe at $0.60c$
relative to itself, we can't have the probe moving at $1.20c$ relative to the earth, because
this would be greater than the maximum speed of cause and effect, $c$. To see how to add velocities
relativistically, we start be rewriting the Lorentz transformation as the matrix
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \cosh\eta  & \sinh\eta \\
    \sinh\eta & \cosh\eta
  \end{pmatrix} \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
where $\eta=\tanh^{-1} v$ is called the \emph{rapidity}.\index{rapidity}
We are guaranteed that the matrix can be written in this form, because its area-preserving
property says that the determinant equals 1, and $\cosh^2\eta-\sinh^2\eta=1$ is an identity
of the hyperbolic trig functions. It is now straightforward to verify that multiplication
of two matrices of this form gives a third matrix which is also of this form, with $\eta=\eta_1+\eta_2$.
In other words, rapidities add linearly; velocities don't. In the example of the spaceship and the
probe, the rapidities add as $\tanh^{-1}.60+\tanh^{-1}.60=.693+.693=1.386$, giving the probe a velocity of
$\tanh 1.386=0.88$ relative to the earth. Any number of velocities can be added in this way, $\eta_1+\eta_2+\ldots+\eta_n$.

<% begin_sec("Logic") %>
The trichotomous classification of causal relationships
has interesting logical implications. In classical Aristotelian logic,\index{logic!Aristotelian}\index{Aristotelian logic}\label{nonaristotelian}
every proposition is either true or false, but not both, and given propositions $p$ and $q$, we
can form propositions such as $p \wedge q$ (both $p$ and $q$) or $p \vee q$ (either $p$ or $q$).
Propositions about physical phenomena can only be verified by observation. Let $p$ be
the statement that a certain observation carried out at event P gives a certain result, and similarly for
$q$ at Q. If PQ is spacelike, then the truth or falsehood of $p \wedge q$ cannot be checked by physically
traveling to P and Q, because no observer would be able to attend both events. The truth-value of
$p \wedge q$ is unknown to any observer in the universe until a certain time, at which the relevant information has
been able to propagate back and forth. What if P and Q lie inside two different black holes? Then the truth-value
of $p \wedge q$ can never be determined by \emph{any} observer. Another example is the case in which P and Q
are separated by such a great distance that, due to the accelerating expansion of the universe, their future
light cones do not overlap. We conclude that Aristotelian logic cannot be appropriately applied to
relativistic observation in this way. Some workers attempting to construct a quantum-mechanical theory of
gravity have suggested an even more radically observer-dependent logic, in which different observes may
contradict one another on the truth-value of a single proposition $p_1$, unless they agree in advance
on the list $p_2$, $p_2$, \ldots of all the other propositions that they intend to test as well. We'll
return to these questions on page \pageref{black-hole-complementarity}.

<% begin_sec("Experimental tests of Lorentzian geometry") %>

We've already seen, in section \ref{sec:time-experiments}, a variety of evidence for the non-classical
behavior of spacetime. We're now in a position to discuss tests of relativity more quantitatively.

One such test is that relativity requires the speed of light to be the same in all frames of reference,
for the following reasons.\label{c-is-speed-of-light} Compare with the speed of sound in air.
The speed of sound is not the same in all frames of reference, because the wave propagates
at a fixed speed relative to the air. An observer at who is moving relative to the air will measure
a different speed of sound. Light, on the other hand isn't a vibration of any physical medium.
Maxwell's equations predict a definite value for the speed of light, regardless of the motion of the
source. This speed also can't be relative to any medium. If the speed of light isn't fixed relative to the
source, and isn't relative to a medium, then it must be fixed relative to any observer.
The only speed in relativity that is equal in all frames of reference is $c$, so light must propagate at $c$.
We will see on page \pageref{c-is-speed-of-massless-particles} that there is a deeper reason for this;
relativity requires that any massless particle propagate at $c$.
The requirement of $v=c$ for massless particles is so intimately hard-wired into the structure of
relativity that any violation of it, no matter how tiny, would be of great interest. Essentially,
such a violation would disprove Lorentz invariance, i.e., the invariance of the laws of physics
under Lorentz transformations. There are two types of tests we could do: (1) test whether photons
of all energies travel at the same speed, i.e., whether the vacuum is dispersive;
(2) test whether observers in all frames of reference measure the same speed of light.

<% begin_sec("Dispersion of the vacuum") %>

Some candidate quantum-mechanical theories of gravity, such as loop quantum gravity,\index{loop quantum gravity}
predict a granular structure for spacetime at the Planck scale, $\sqrt{\hbar G/c^3}=10^{-35}$ m, which would naturally lead to
deviations from $v=1$ that would become more and more significant for photons with wavelengths
getting closer and closer to that scale. Lorentz-invariance would then be an approximation valid
only at large scales.

Presently the best experimental tests of the invariance of
the speed of light with respect to wavelength come from astronomical observations of gamma-ray bursts, which are sudden
outpourings of high-energy photons, believed to originate from a supernova explosion in another galaxy. One such observation,
in 2009,\footnote{\url{http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1832}} collected photons from such a burst, with a duration of 2 seconds, indicating that the propagation
time of all the photons differed by no more than 2 seconds out of a total time in flight on the order
of ten billion years, or about one part in $10^{17}$! A single superlative photon in the burst had an energy of 31 GeV,
and its arrival within the same 2-second time window demonstrates Lorentz invariance over a vast range of photon energies,
ruling out some versions of loop quantum gravity.

The constancy of the speed of light for observers in all frames of reference
was originally detected in 1887 when
Michelson and Morley set up a clever apparatus to
measure any difference in the speed of light beams traveling
east-west and north-south. The motion of the earth around
the sun at 110,000 km/hour (about 0.01\% of the speed of
light) is to our west during the day. Michelson and Morley
believed that light was a vibration of a physical medium, the ether, so they expected that the
speed of light would be a fixed value relative to the ether.
As the earth moved through the ether, they thought they
would observe an effect on the velocity of light along an
east-west line. For instance, if they released a beam of
light in a westward direction during the day, they expected
that it would move away from them at less than the normal
speed because the earth was chasing it through the ether.
They were surprised when they found that the expected 0.01\%
change in the speed of light did not occur.\index{Michelson-Morley experiment}\index{ether}

Although the Michelson-Morley experiment was nearly two
dec\-ades in the past by the time Einstein published his first
paper on relativity in 1905, and Einstein did know about it,\footnote{J. van Dongen, http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1545} 
it's unclear how much it influenced him. Michelson
and Morley themselves were uncertain about whether the result was to be trusted,
or whether systematic and random errors were masking a real effect from
the ether. There were a variety of competing theories, each of which could
claim some support from the shaky data. Some physicists believed
that the ether could be dragged along by matter moving through it, which inspired
variations on the experiment that were conducted on mountaintops in thin-walled buildings, (figure),
or with one arm of the apparatus out in the open, and the other surrounded by massive lead walls.
In the standard sanitized textbook version of the history of science, every scientist does his experiments
without any preconceived notions about the truth, and any disagreement is quickly settled by
a definitive experiment. In reality, this period of confusion about the Michelson-Morley
experiment lasted for four decades, and a few reputable skeptics,
including Miller, continued to believe that Einstein was wrong, and kept trying different variations
of the experiment as late as the 1920's. Most of the remaining doubters were convinced
by an extremely precise version of the experiment performed by Joos in 1930, although you can still
find kooks on the internet who insist  that Miller was right, and that there was a vast conspiracy to
cover up his results.

Before Einstein, some physicists who did believe the negative result of the Michelson-Morley experiment came up with
explanations that preserved the ether. In the period from 1889 to 1895, both Lorentz and George FitzGerald
suggested that the negative result of the Michelson-Morley
experiment could be explained if the earth, and every physical
object on its surface, was contracted slightly by the strain
of the earth's motion through the ether. Thus although Lorentz developed all the mathematics of Lorentz
frames, and got them named after himself, he got the interpretation wrong.

New and nontrivial phenomena arise when we generalize from 1+1 dimensions to 3+1.
<% begin_sec("Lorentz boosts in three dimensions") %>\label{lorentz-three-dim}
How does a Lorentz boost along one axis, say $x$, affect the other two spatial coordinates $y$ and $z$?
We have
already proved that area in the $(t,x)$ plane is preserved. The same proof applies to volume in the spaces
$(t,x,y)$ and $(t,x,z)$, hence lengths in the $y$ and $z$ directions are preserved. (The proof does \emph{not} apply to
volume in, e.g., $(x,y,z)$ space, because the $x$ transformation depends on $t$, and therefore if we are given
a region in $(x,y,z)$, we do not have enough information to say how it will change under a Lorentz boost.)
The complete form of the transformation $L(v\hat{\vc{x}})$, a Lorentz boost along the $x$ axis with velocity $v$, is therefore:
\begin{align*}
  t' &= \gamma t + v \gamma x \\
  x' &= v \gamma t + \gamma x \\
  y' &= y \\
  z' &= z
\end{align*}

Based on the trivial nature of this generalization, it might seem as though no qualitatively new considerations
would arise in 3+1 dimensions as compared with 1+1.  To see that this is not the case, consider figure \figref{boosts-tangling}.
A boost along the $x$ axis tangles up the $x$ and $t$ coordinates. A $y$-boost mingles $y$ and $t$. Therefore
consecutive boosts along $x$ and $y$ can cause $x$ and $y$ to mix. The result, as we'll see in more detail below,
is that two consecutive boosts along non-collinear axes are not equivalent to a single boost; they are equivalent
to a boost plus a spatial rotation.

which in its simplest incarnation is a closed loop of optical fiber with a bidirectional laser
inserted in one place. Coherent light traverses the loop simultaneously in both directions, interfering
in a beat pattern, which can be observed by sampling the light at some point along the loop's
circumference. If the loop is rotated in its own plane, the interference pattern is altered,
because the beam-sampling device is in a different place, and the path lengths traveled by the
two beams has been altered. This phase shift is called the Sagnac effect.\index{Sagnac effect}
The loop senses its own angular acceleration relative to an inertial reference frame.
If we transport the loop while always carefully adjusting its orientation so as to prevent
phase shifts, then its orientation has been preserved. 
The atomic clocks used in the Hafele-Keating atomic-clock experiment\index{Hafele-Keating experiment}\index{atomic clocks}
described
on page \pageref{sec:hafele-keating} were sensitive to Sagnac effects, and it was not practical
to maintain their orientations while they were strapped into seats on a passenger jet, so
this orientational effect had to be subtracted out of the data at the end of the experiment.

In three spatial dimensions, we could build a spherical cavity with
a reflective inner surface, and release a photon inside.

\label{types-of-gyroscopes}
In reality, the photon-in-a-cavity is not very practical. The photon would eventually be
absorbed or scattered, and it would also be difficult to accurately initialize the device and read it out later. A more practical
tool is a gyroscope.  For example, one of the classic tests of general relativity is the
2007 Gravity Probe B\index{Gravity Probe B} experiment (discussed in detail on pages
\pageref{sec:geodetic-effect-estimate} and \pageref{sec:geodetic-effect-exact}), in which
four gyroscopes aboard a satellite were observed to precess due to special- and general-relativistic
effects.

The gyroscope, however, is not so obviously a literal implementation of our basic concept of a direction. How, then,
can we be sure that its behavior is equivalent to that of the photon-in-a-cavity? We could, for example,
carry out a complete mathematical development of the angular momentum vector in relativity.\footnote{This is done,
for example, in Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler, \emph{Gravitation}, pp. 157-159.} The equivalence principle, however,
allows us to bypass such technical details. Suppose that we seal the two devices inside black boxes, with identical
external control panels for initializing them and reading them out. We initialize them identically, and then
transport them along side-by-side world-lines. Classically, both the mechanical gyroscope and the photon-gyroscope
would maintain absolute, fixed directions in space. Relativistically, they will not necessarily maintain their
orientations. For example, we've already seen in section \ref{lorentz-three-dim} that there are reasons to
expect that their orientations will change if they are subjected to accelerations that are not all along the
same line. Because relativity is a geometrical theory of spacetime, this difference between the classical
and relativistic behavior must be determinable from purely geometrical considerations, such as the
shape of the world-line. If it depended on something else, then we could conceivably see a disagreement in the
outputs of the two instruments, but this would violate the equivalence principle.

Suppose there were such a discrepancy. That discrepancy would be a physically measurable property of the
space\-time region through which the two gyroscopes had been transported. The effect would have a certain
magnitude and direction, so by collecting enough data we could map it out as vector field covering that region of spacetime.
This field evidently causes material particles to accelerate, since it has an effect on the mechanical gyroscope.
Roughly speaking (the reasoning will be filled
in more rigorously on page \pageref{tensor-universality}),
the fact that this field acts differently on the two gyroscopes is like getting a non-null result from
an E\"{o}tv\"{o}s experiment, and it therefore violates the equivalence principle. 
We conclude that the two gyroscopes are equivalent. In other words, there can only be one uniquely
defined notion of direction, and the details of how it is implemented are irrelevant.

As a quantitative example, consider the following
thought experiment. Put a gyroscope in a box, and
send the box around the square path shown in figure \figref{thomas-hammers}
at constant speed. The gyroscope defines a local coordinate system, which according to classical
physics would maintain its orientation. At each corner of the square, the box has its velocity vector changed abruptly,
as represented by the hammer. We assume that the hits with the hammer are transmitted to the gyroscopes at their centers
center of mass, so that they do not result in any torque. Classically, if the set of gyroscopes travels once around
the square, it should end up at the same place and in the same orientation, so that the coordinate system it defines
is identical with the original one.

%>
<% end_marg %>

For notation, let $L(v\hat{\vc{x}})$ indicate the boost along the $x$ axis described by the transformation
on page \pageref{lorentz-three-dim}. This is a transformation that changes to a frame of reference moving in the
\emph{negative} $x$ direction compared to the original frame.
A particle considered to be at rest in the original frame is described in the new frame as moving in the \emph{positive} $x$ direction.
Applying such an $L$ to a vector $\vc{p}$, we calculate $L\vc{p}$, which gives the coordinates of the event as measured in the
new frame. An expression like $ML\vc{p}$ is equivalent by associativity to $M(L\vc{p})$, i.e., $ML$ represents applying $L$ first, and then
$M$.

In this notation, the hammer strikes can be represented by a series of four Lorentz boosts,
\begin{equation*}
  T = L(v\hat{\vc{x}}) \: L(v\hat{\vc{y}}) \: L(-v\hat{\vc{x}}) \: L(-v\hat{\vc{y}}) \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
where we assume that the square has negligible size,
so that all four Lorentz boosts act in a way that preserves the origin of the coordinate systems. (We have no convenient way in
our notation $L(\ldots)$ to describe a transformation that does not preserve the origin.) The first
transformation, $L(-v\hat{\vc{y}})$, changes coordinates measured by the original gyroscope-defined frame to new
coordinates measured by the new gyroscope-defined frame, after the box has been accelerated in the positive $y$ direction.

The calculation of $T$ is messy, and to be honest, I made a series of mistakes when I tried to crank it out by hand.
Calculations in relativity have a reputation for being like this. Figure \figref{einstein-notebook} shows a page from one of
Einstein's notebooks, written in fountain pen around 1913. At the bottom of the page, he wrote ``zu umstaendlich,''
meaning ``too involved.'' 
Luckily we live in an era in which this sort of thing can be handled by computers. Starting at this point in the
book, I will take appropriate opportunities to demonstrate how to use the
free and open-source computer algebra system Maxima\index{Maxima}\label{introduce-maxima}
to keep complicated calculations manageable. The following Maxima program calculates a particular element of the matrix
$T$.

On line 2, we see a symbolic definition of the symbol \verb@gamma@ in terms of the symbol \verb@v@. The colon
means ``is defined as.''
Line 2 does not mean, as it would in most programming languages, to take a stored numerical value of $v$ and use it to calculate a numerical
value of $\gamma$. In fact, $v$ does not have a numerical value defined at this point, nor will it ever have a numerical value defined
for it throughout this program. Line 2 simply means that whenever Maxima encounters the symbol \verb@gamma@, it should take it
as an abbreviation for the symbol \verb@v@. Lines 5-16 define some $3\times3$ matrices that represent the $L$ transformations.
The basis is $\hat{\vc{t}}$, $\hat{\vc{x}}$, $\hat{\vc{y}}$.
Line 18 calculates the product of the four matrices; the dots represent matrix multiplication.
Line 23 defines a point in spacetime $\zu{P}=\hat{\vc{t}}+\hat{\vc{x}}$; we have in mind the direction
that includes the lightlike line OP. P has to be expressed as a column matrix (three rows of one column each)
so that Maxima will know how to operate using matrix multiplication by $T$.

Finally line 26 outputs\footnote{I've omitted some output generated automatically from the earlier steps in the
computation. The (\%o9) indicates that this is Maxima's output from the ninth and final step.} the result of $T$ acting on P:
\begin{listing}{19}

\end{listing}
In other words,
\begin{equation*}
  T\begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 1 \\ 0\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ 1 \\ -v^2\end{pmatrix} + \ldots \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
where $\ldots$ represents higher-order terms in $v$.
The interpretation is as follows.
Let  $\zu{O}=(0,0,0)$ be the origin. We can interpret OP as defining a direction.
Since O is not affected by $T$, the transformed version, $\zu{P}\rightarrow T\zu{P}$, output by the program
represents the same direction, after being acted on by $T$.
Suppose that we use the initial frame of reference, before $T$ is applied, to determine that
a particular reference point, such as a distant star, is along the $x$ axis. We represent that
spatial direction using P. Applying $T$, we get a new vector $T\zu{P}$, which we find has
a nonvanishing $y$ component approximately equal to $-v^2$. This result is entirely unexpected classically.
It tells us that the gyroscope, rather than maintaining its original orientation as it
would have done classically, has rotated slightly. It has precessed in the counterclockwise
direction in the $x-y$ plane, so that the direction to the star, as measured in the
coordinate system defined by the gyroscope, appears to have rotated clockwise.
As the box moved clockwise around the square, the gyroscope has apparently rotated by
a counterclockwise angle $\chi\approx v^2$ about the $z$ axis.
We can see that this is a purely relativistic effect, since for
$v \ll 1$ the effect is small. For historical reasons discussed in section \ref{sec:thomas-precession}, this
phenomenon is referred to as the Thomas precession.

% The following is a conditional because it's a note to myself, but it can be handy to see it typeset:

 Applying it to (0,1,0) gives middle column as result. As a check on the result, I checked that norm squared is exactly -1 after transformation.

The particular features of this geometry are not necessary. I chose them so that (1) the boosts
would be along the Cartesian axes, so that we would be able to write them down easily; (2) it is clear that the effect
doesn't arise from any asymmetric treatment of the spatial axes; and (3) the change in the orientation of the gyroscope
can be measured at the same point in space, e.g., by comparing it with a twin gyroscope that stays at home. In general:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] A gyroscope transported around a closed loop in flat spacetime changes its orientation compared with
             one that is not accelerated.
\item[] This is a purely relativistic effect, since a classical gyroscope does not change its axis of rotation
       unless subjected to a torque; if the boosts are accomplished by forces that act at the gyroscope's center of mass,
       then there is no classical explanation for the effect.
\item[] The effect can occur in the absence of any gravitational fields. That is, this is a phenomenon of special relativity.
\item[] The composition of two or more Lorentz boosts along different axes is not equivalent to a single boost; it is
             equivalent to a boost plus a spatial rotation.
\item[] Lorentz boosts do not commute, i.e., it makes a difference what order we perform them in.
         Even if there is almost no time lag between the first boost and the second, the order of the boosts matters.
         If we had applied the boosts in the opposite order, the handedness of the effect would have been reversed.
\end{itemize}

Self-check: If Lorentz boosts \emph{did} commute, what would be the consequences
for the expression $L(v\hat{\vc{x}}) \: L(v\hat{\vc{y}}) \: L(-v\hat{\vc{x}}) \: L(-v\hat{\vc{y}})$?

<% begin_sec("The velocity disk") %>
Figure \figref{velocity-disk} shows a useful way of visualizing the combined effects of boosts and
rotations in 2+1 dimensions.
The disk depicts all
possible states of motion relative to some arbitrarily chosen frame of reference. Lack of motion is represented by the point at the
center. A point at distance $v$ from the center represents motion at velocity $v$ in a particular direction in the $x-y$ plane.
By drawing little axes at a particular point, we can represent a particular frame of reference: the frame is in motion at
some velocity, with its own $x$ and $y$ axes are oriented in a particular way.

It turns out to be easier to understand the qualitative behavior of our mysterious rotations if we switch from the low-velocity limit
to the contrary limit of ultrarelativistic velocities.
Suppose we have a rocket-ship with an inertial navigation system consisting of two gyroscopes at right angles to one another.
We first accelerate the ship in the $y$ direction, and the acceleration is steady 
in the sense that it feels constant to observers
aboard the ship. Since it is rapidities, not velocities, that add linearly, this means that as an observer aboard the ship reads clock
times $\tau_1$, $\tau_2$, \ldots, all separated by equal intervals $\Delta\tau$, the ship's rapidity changes at a constant
rate, $\eta_1$, $\eta_2$, \ldots.
This results in a series of frames of reference that appear closer and closer together as the ship approaches the speed of light,
at the edge of the disk. We can start over from the center again and repeat the whole process along the $x$ axis, resulting in a
similar succession of frames. In both cases, the boosts are being applied along a single line, so that there is no rotation of
the $x$ and $y$ axes.

  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

Now suppose that the ship were to accelerate along a route like the one shown in figure \figref{velocity-disk-accel-question}.
It first accelerates along the $y$ axis at a constant
rate (again, as judged by its own sensors), until its velocity is very close to the speed of light, A. It then accelerates,
again at a self-perceived constant rate and with thrust in a fixed direction as judged by its own gyroscopes, until it is moving at the
same ultrarelativistic speed in the $x$ direction, B. Finally, it decelerates in the $x$ direction until it is again at rest, O.
This motion traces out a clockwise loop on the velocity disk. The motion in space is also clockwise.

We might naively think that the middle leg of the trip, from A to B, would be a straight line on the velocity disk, but this can't be the case.
First, we know that non-collinear boosts cause rotations. Traveling around a clockwise path causes counterclockwise rotation, and vice-versa.
Therefore an observer in the rest frame O sees the ship (and its gyroscopes)
as rotating as it moves from A to B. The ship's trajectory through space is clockwise, so according to O the ship rotates counterclockwise as it goes
A to B.
The ship is always firing its engines in a fixed direction as judged by its gyroscopes, but according to O the ship is rotating counterclockwise,
its thrust is progressively rotating counterclockwise, and therefore its trajectory turns counterclockwise. We conclude that leg AB
on the velocity disk is concave, rather than being a straight-line hypotenuse of a triangle OAB.

We can also determine, by the following argument, that leg AB is perpendicular to the edge of the disk where it touches the edge of the disk.
In the transformation from frame A to frame O, $y$ coordinates are dilated by a factor of $\gamma$, which approaches infinity in the limit
we're presently considering. Observers aboard the rocket-ship, occupying frame A, believe that their task is to fire the rocket's engines
at an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the $y$ axis, so as to eliminate their velocity with respect to the origin, and simultaneously
add an equal amount of velocity in the $x$ direction. This 45-degree angle in frame A, however, is not a 45-degree angle in frame O.
From the stern of the ship to its bow we have displacements $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$, and in the transformation from A to O, $\Delta y$
is magnified almost infinitely. As perceived in frame O, the ship's orientation is almost exactly antiparallel to the $y$ axis.\footnote{Although
we will not need any more than this for the purposes of our present analysis, a
longer and more detailed discussion by Rhodes and Semon, \url{www.bates.edu/~msemon/RhodesSemonFinal.pdf}, Am. J. Phys. 72(7)2004, shows that
this type of inertially guided, constant-thrust motion is always represented on the velocity disk by
an arc of a circle that is perpendicular to the disk at its edge. (We consider a diameter of the disk to be
the limiting case of a circle with infinite radius.)}
<% marg(20) %>
<%
  fig(
    'velocity-disk-loop-filled-in',
    %q{In the limit where A and B are ultrarelativistic velocities, leg AB is perpendicular to the edge of the velocity disk.
            The result is that the $x-y$ frame determined by the ship's gyroscopes has rotated by 90 degrees by the time it
            gets home.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

As the ship travels from A to B, its orientation (as judged in frame O) changes from $-\hat{\vc{y}}$ to $\hat{\vc{x}}$.
This establishes, in a much more direct fashion, the direction of the Thomas precession: its handedness is contrary to the handedness of the direction of motion.
We can now also see something new about the fundamental reason for the effect. It has to do with the fact that observers in
different states of motion disagree on spatial angles. Similarly, imagine that you are a two-dimensional being who was
told about the existence of a new, third, spatial dimension. You have always believed that the cosine of the angle between
two unit vectors $\vc{u}$ and $\vc{v}$ is given by the vector dot product $u_xv_x+u_yv_y$. If you were allowed to explore
a two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional scene, e.g., on the flat screen of a television, it would seem to you
as if all the angles had been distorted. You would have no way to interpret the visual conventions of perspective.
But once you had learned about the existence of a $z$ axis, you would realize that these angular distortions were
happening because of rotations out of the $x-y$ plane. Such rotations really conserve the quantity $u_xv_x+u_yv_y+u_zv_z$; only
because you were ignoring the $u_zv_z$ term did it seem that angles were not being preserved. Similarly, the generalization
from three Euclidean spatial dimensions to 3+1-dimensional spacetime means that three-dimensional dot products are no
longer conserved.

Let's find the low-$v$ limit of the Thomas precession in general, not just in the highly artificial
special case of $\chi\approx v^2$ for the example involving the four hammer hits.
To generalize to the case of smooth acceleration, we first note that the rate of precession $\der\chi/\der t$ must have the following properties.
\begin{itemize}
\item[] It is odd under a reversal of the direction of motion, $\vc{v}\rightarrow-\vc{v}$. (This corresponds to applying the four hammer hits
              in the opposite order.)
\item[] It is odd under a reversal of the acceleration due to the second boost, $\vc{a}\rightarrow-\vc{a}$.
\item[] It is a rotation about the spatial axis perpendicular to the plane of the $\vc{v}$ and $\vc{a}$ vectors, in the opposite direction compared
              to the handedness of the curving trajectory.
\item[] It is approximately linear in $\vc{v}$ and $\vc{a}$, for small $\vc{v}$ and $\vc{a}$.
\end{itemize}
The only rotationally invariant mathematical operation that has these symmetry properties is the
vector cross  product, so the rate of precession
must be $k\vc{a}\times\vc{v}$, where $k>0$ is nearly independent of
$\vc{v}$ and $\vc{a}$ for small $\vc{v}$ and $\vc{a}$.

To pin down the value of $k$, we need to find a connection between our two results: $\chi\approx v^2$ for the four hammer hits,
and $\der\chi/\der t\approx k\vc{a}\times\vc{v}$ for smooth acceleration. We can do this by considering the physical significance of
areas on the velocity disk. As shown in figure \figref{thomas-as-area}, the rotation $\chi$ due to carrying the velocity around the boundary of a region is
additive when adjacent regions are joined together. We can therefore find $\chi$ for any region by breaking the region down into
elements of area $\der A$ and integrating their contributions $\der\chi$. What is the relationship between $\der A$ and $\der\chi$?
The velocity disk's structure is nonuniform, in the sense that near the edge of the disk, it takes a larger boost to move a small
distance. But we're investigating the low-velocity limit, and in the low-velocity region near the center of the disk, the disk's structure
is approximately uniform. We therefore expect that there is an approximately constant proportionality factor relating $\der A$ and $\der\chi$
at low velocities. The example of the hammer corresponds geometrically to a square with area $v^2$, so we find that this proportionality factor
is unity, $\der A\approx\der\chi$.

% Rhodes and Semon have a metric that for small v's is approximately ds=2dv; so area is 4v2; this seems to lead to k=2, which is inconsistent with Jackson

To relate this to smooth acceleration, consider a particle performing
circular motion with period $T$, which has $|\vc{a}\times\vc{v}|=2\pi v^2/T$.
Over one full period of the motion, we have $\chi=\int k |\vc{a}\times\vc{v}| \der t=2\pi kv^2$, and the
particle's velocity vector traces a circle of area $A=\pi v^2$ on the velocity disk. Equating $A$ and $\chi$, we
find $k=1/2$. The result is that in the limit of low velocities, the rate of rotation is
\begin{equation*}
 \boldsymbol{\Omega} \approx \frac{1}{2}\vc{a}\times\vc{v} \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
where $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$ is the angular velocity vector of the rotation.
In the special case of circular motion, this can be written as $\Omega=(1/2)v^2\omega$, where $\omega=2\pi/T$ is
the angular frequency of the motion.

If we want to see this precession effect in real life, we should look for a system in which both $v$ and $a$ are large.
An atom is such a system.

The Bohr model,\index{Bohr model} introduced in 1913, marked the first quantitatively successful, if
conceptually muddled, description of the atomic energy levels of hydrogen. Continuing to take $c=1$,
the over-all scale of the energies was calculated to be proportional to $m\alpha^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the
electron, and $\alpha=ke^2/\hbar\approx1/137$, known as the fine structure constant,\index{fine structure constant}
is essentially just a unitless way of expressing the coupling constant for electrical forces.
At higher resolution, each excited energy level is found to be split into several sub-levels. The transitions among
these close-lying states are in the millimeter region of the microwave spectrum. The energy scale of this fine structure is
$\sim m\alpha^4$. This is down by a factor of $\alpha^2$ compared to the visible-light transitions,
hence the name of the constant. Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit\index{Uhlenbeck}\index{Goudsmit} showed in 1926 that a splitting on this order of magnitude
was to be expected due to the magnetic
interaction between the proton and the electron's magnetic moment, oriented along its spin. The effect they calculated,
however, was too big by a factor of two. 

The explanation of the mysterious factor of two had in fact been implicit in a 1916 calculation by
Willem de Sitter,\index{de Sitter!Willem} one of the first applications of general relativity. De Sitter
treated the earth-moon system as a gyroscope, and found the precession of its axis of rotation,
which was partly due to the curvature of spacetime and partly due to the type of rotation described earlier
in this section.
The effect on the motion of the moon was noncumulative, and was only about one meter, which was much
too small to be measured at the time. In 1927, however,  Llewellyn Thomas\index{Thomas!Llewellyn}
applied similar reasoning to the hydrogen atom, with the electron's spin vector playing the role of gyroscope.
Since gravity is negligible here, the effect has nothing to do with curvature of spacetime, and Thomas's
effect corresponds purely to the special-relativistic part of de Sitter's result. It is simply the
rotation described above, with $\Omega=(1/2)v^2\omega$. Although Thomas was not the first to calculate it,
the effect is known as Thomas precession.
Since the electron's spin is $\hbar/2$, the energy splitting is $\pm(\hbar/2)\Omega$, depending on whether the
electron's spin is in the same direction as its orbital motion, or in the opposite direction. This is less than the
atom's gross energy scale $\hbar\omega$ by a factor of $v^2/2$, which is $\sim\alpha^2$. The Thomas
precession cancels out half of the magnetic effect, bringing theory in agreement with experiment.

Uhlenbeck later recalled: ``...when I first heard about [the Thomas precession], it seemed unbelievable that a
relativistic effect could give a factor of 2 instead of something of order $v/c$...  Even
the cognoscenti of relativity theory (Einstein included!) were quite surprised.''

Example \ref{eg:newtonian-black-hole} on page \pageref{eg:newtonian-black-hole} discusses
relativistic bounds on the properties of matter, using the example of pulling a bucket
out of a black hole. Derive a similar bound by considering the possibility of sending signals
out of the black hole using longitudinal vibrations of a cable, as in the child's telephone made
of two tin cans connected by a piece of string. (Surprisingly subtle issues can arise in such
calculations. See A.Y. Shiekh, Can. J. Phys. 70, 458 (1992).)
