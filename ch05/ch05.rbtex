General relativity describes gravitation as a curvature of spacetime, with matter acting as the source
of the curvature in the same way that electric charge acts as the source of electric fields.
Our goal is to arrive at Einstein's field equations, which relate the local intrinsic curvature to the locally
ambient matter in the same way that Gauss's law relates the local divergence of the electric field to the
charge density. The locality of the equations is necessary because relativity has no action at a distance;
cause and effect propagate at a maximum velocity of $c(=1)$.

The hard part is arriving at the right way of defining curvature. We've already
seen that it can be tricky to distinguish intrinsic curvature, which is real, from extrinsic curvature, which
can never produce observable effects. E.g., example \ref{eg:extrinsic-curvature} on page \pageref{eg:extrinsic-curvature}
showed that spheres have intrinsic curvature, while cylinders do not. The manifestly intrinsic tensor notation protects
us from being misled in this respect. If we can formulate a definition of curvature expressed using only
tensors that are expressed without reference to any preordained coordinate system, then we know
it is physically observable, and not just a superficial feature of a particular model.

As an example, drop two rocks side by side, \figref{dropping-rocks-no-intrinsic-curvature}. Their trajectories are vertical, but on a $(t,x)$ coordinate plot
rendered in the Earth's frame of reference, they appear as parallel parabolas. The curvature of these parabolas
is extrinsic. The Earth-fixed frame of reference is defined by an observer who is subject to non-gravitational
forces, and is therefore not a valid Lorentz frame. In a free-falling Lorentz frame $(t',x')$, the two rocks are
either motionless or moving at constant velocity in straight lines. We can therefore see that the curvature of
world-lines in a particular coordinate system is not an intrinsic measure of curvature; it can arise simply
from the choice of the coordinate system. What would indicate intrinsic curvature would be, for example, if geodesics
that were initially parallel were to converge or diverge.

    'dropping-rocks-no-intrinsic-curvature',
    %q{Two rocks are dropped side by side. The curvatures of their world-lines are not intrinsic. In a free-falling frame,
             both would appear straight. If initially parallel world-lines
             became non-parallel, that would be evidence of intrinsic curvature.}

Nor is the metric a measure of intrinsic curvature. In example \ref{eg:const-accel-metric}
on page \pageref{eg:const-accel-metric}, we found the metric for an accelerated observer to be
\begin{equation*}
  g'_{t't'} = (1+ax')^2 \qquad  g_{x'x'} = -1 \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
where the primes indicate the accelerated observer's frame.
The fact that the timelike element is not equal to $-1$ is not an indication of intrinsic curvature. It arises only
from the choice of the coordinates $(t',x')$ defined by a frame tied to the accelerating rocket ship.

The fact that the above metric has nonvanishing derivatives, unlike a constant Lorentz metric, does indicate the
presence of a gravitational field. However, a gravitational field is not the same thing as intrinsic curvature.
The gravitational field seen by an observer aboard the ship is, by the equivalence principle, indistinguishable
from an acceleration, and indeed the Lorentzian observer in the earth's frame does describe it as arising from
the ship's acceleration, not from a gravitational field permeating all of space. Both observers must agree
that ``I got plenty of nothin' '' --- that the region of the universe to which they have access lacks any
stars, neutrinos, or clouds of dust. The observer aboard the ship must describe the gravitational field
he detects as arising from some source very far away, perhaps a hypothetical vast sheet of lead lying
billions of light-years aft of the ship's deckplates. Such a hypothesis is fine, but it is unrelated to
the structure of our hoped-for field equation, which is to be \emph{local} in nature.

Not only does the metric tensor not represent the gravitational field, but no tensor can represent it.
By the equivalence principle, any gravitational field seen by observer A can be eliminated
by switching to the frame of a free-falling observer B who is instantaneously at rest with respect to
A at a certain time. The structure of the tensor transformation law guarantees that A and B
will agree on whether a given tensor is zero at the point in spacetime where they pass by one
another. Since they agree on all tensors, and disagree on the gravitational field, the gravitational
field cannot be a tensor.

We therefore conclude
that a nonzero intrinsic curvature of the type
that is to be included in the Einstein field equations is not encoded in any simple way in the metric or
its first derivatives. Since neither the metric nor its first derivatives indicate curvature, we can reasonably
conjecture that the curvature might be encoded in its second derivatives.

  fig(
    'comet',
    %q{Tidal forces disrupt comet Shoemaker-Levy.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

A further complication is the need to distinguish tidal curvature from curvature caused by local sources.
Figure \figref{comet} shows Comet Shoemaker-Levy, broken up into a string of fragments by Jupiter's tidal forces shortly
before its spectacular impact with the planet in 1994. Immediately after each fracture,
the newly separated chunks had almost zero velocity relative to one another, so once the comet finished
breaking up, the fragments' world-lines were a sheaf of nearly
parallel lines separated by spatial distances of only $~1$ km. These initially parallel geodesics
then diverged, eventually fanning out to span millions of kilometers.

If initially parallel lines
lose their parallelism, that is clearly an indication of intrinsic curvature. We call it a measure of \emph{sectional
curvature},\index{curvature!sectional}
because the loss of parallelism occurs within a particular plane, in this case the
$(t,x)$ plane represented by figure \figref{sectional-curvature}.

  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

But this curvature was not caused by a local source lurking in among the fragments. It was caused by a distant source:
Jupiter. We therefore see that the mere presence of sectional curvature is not enough to demonstrate the
existence of local sources. Even the sign of the sectional curvature is not a reliable indication. Although
this example showed a divergence of initially parallel geodesics, referred to as a negative curvature,
it is also possible for tidal forces exerted by distant masses to create positive curvature. For example, the ocean
tides on earth oscillate both above and below mean sea level, \figref{high-and-low-tides}.

As an example that really would indicate the presence of a local source, we could release a cloud of test masses
at rest in a spherical shell around the earth, and allow them to drop, \figref{earth-ricci-curvature}. We would then have positive and equal sectional
curvature in the $t-x$, $t-y$, and $t-z$ planes. Such an observation cannot be due to a distant mass.
It demonstrates an over-all contraction of the volume of an initially parallel sheaf of geodesics, which
can never be induced by tidal forces. The earth's oceans, for example, do not change their total volume due to
the tides, and this would be true even if the oceans were a gas rather than an incompressible fluid. It is a unique
property of  $1/r^2$ forces such as gravity that they conserve volume in this way; this is essentially a restatement
of Gauss's law in a vacuum.

<% begin_sec("The stress-energy tensor") %>\label{sec:energy-momentum-tensor}

In general, the curvature of spacetime will contain contributions from both tidal forces and local sources, superimposed
on one another. To develop the right formulation for the Einstein field equations, we need to eliminate the tidal
part. Roughly speaking, we will do this by averaging the sectional curvature over all three of the planes
$t-x$, $t-y$, and $t-z$, giving a measure of curvature called the Ricci curvature.\index{Ricci curvature}\index{curvature!Ricci}
The ``roughly speaking'' is because such a prescription would treat the time
and space coordinates in an extremely asymmetric manner, which would violate local Lorentz invariance.

To get an idea of how this would work, let's compare with the Newtonian case, where there really is an asymmetry
between the treatment of time and space. In the Cartan curved-spacetime theory of Newtonian gravity
(page \pageref{cartan-newtonian}),\index{Cartan!curved-spacetime theory of Newtonian gravity}
the field equation has a kind of scalar Ricci curvature on one side, and on the other side is the density of mass, which is also a scalar.
In relativity, however, the source term in the equation clearly cannot be the scalar mass density.
We know that mass and energy are equivalent in relativity, so for example the curvature of spacetime
around the earth depends not just on the mass of its atoms but also on all the other forms of energy
it contains, such as thermal energy and electromagnetic and nuclear binding energy. Can the source
term in the Einstein field equations therefore be the mass-energy $E$? No, because $E$ is merely the
timelike component of a particle's momentum four-vector. To single it out would violate Lorentz invariance
just as much as an asymmetric treatment of time and space in constructing a Ricci measure of curvature.
To get a properly Lorentz invariant theory, we need to find a way to formulate everything in terms of tensor
equations that make no explicit reference to coordinates. The proper generalization of the Newtonian
mass density in relativity is the stress-energy tensor $T^{ij}$,\index{stress-energy tensor}
whose 16 elements measure the local density of mass-energy and momentum, and also the rate of transport of
these quantities in various directions.
If we happen to be able to find a frame of reference in which the local matter is
all at rest, then $T^{00}$ represents the mass density.

For the purposes of the present discussion,
it's not necessary to introduce the explicit definition of $T$; the point is merely that we should expect the
Einstein field equations to be tensor equations, which tells us that the definition of curvature we're
seeking clearly has to be a rank-2 tensor, not a scalar.
The implications in four-dimensional spacetime are fairly complex.
We'll end up with a rank-4 tensor that measures the sectional curvature, and a rank-2 Ricci tensor derived
from it that averages away the tidal effects. The Einstein field equations then relate the Ricci tensor to the energy-momentum
tensor in a certain way. The stress-energy tensor is discussed further in section \ref{sec:more-energy-mom-tensor}
on page \pageref{sec:more-energy-mom-tensor}.

<% begin_sec("Curvature in two spacelike dimensions") %>\index{curvature!in two spacelike dimensions}
Since the curvature tensors in 3+1 dimensions are complicated, let's start by considering lower dimensions.
In one dimension, \figref{no-intrinsic-curvature-in-one-dim}, there is no such thing as intrinsic curvature.\index{curvature!none in one dimension} This is because curvature describes the
failure of parallelism to behave as in E5, but there is no notion of parallelism in one dimension.

The lowest interesting dimension is therefore two, and this case was studied by Carl Friedrich Gauss in the
early nineteenth century. Gauss ran a geodesic survey of the state of Hanover, inventing an optical surveying
instrument called a heliotrope that in effect was used to cover the Earth's surface with a triangular
mesh of light rays. If one of the mesh points lies, for example, at the peak of a mountain,
then the sum $\Sigma\theta$ of the angles of the vertices meeting at that point will be less than $2\pi$, in contradiction
to Euclid. Although the light rays do travel through the air above the dirt, we can think of them as approximations
to geodesics painted directly on the dirt, which would be intrinsic rather than extrinsic.
The angular defect\index{angular defect} around a vertex now vanishes, because the space is locally Euclidean, but
we now pick up a different kind of angular defect,
which is that the interior angles of a triangle no longer add up to the Euclidean value
of $\pi$.

\begin{eg}{A polygonal survey of a soccer ball}\label{eg:soccer-ball}
% -------- see soccer.pl for calculation of angles
Figure \figref{soccer-ball} applies similar ideas to a soccer ball, the only difference being the use of pentagons and hexagons rather than triangles.

         In \subfigref{soccer-ball}{1}, the survey is extrinsic, because the lines pass below the surface of the sphere.
         The curvature is detectable because the angles at each vertex add up to $120+120+110=350$ degrees, giving an angular defect of 10 degrees.

In \subfigref{soccer-ball}{2}, the lines have been projected to form arcs of great circles on the surface of the sphere.
         Because the space is locally Euclidean, the sum of the angles at a vertex has its Euclidean value of 360 degrees. The curvature can be
         detected, however, because the sum of the internal angles of a polygon is greater than the Euclidean value. For example, each spherical hexagon
         gives a sum of $6\times 124.31$ degrees, rather than the Euclidean $6\times120$. The angular defect of $6\times4.31$ degrees is an intrinsic measure of curvature.

\begin{eg}{Angular defect on the earth's surface}\label{eg:octant}
Divide the Earth's northern hemisphere into four octants, with their boundaries running through the north pole.
These octants have sides that are geodesics, so they are equilateral triangles. Assuming Euclidean
geometry, the interior angles of an equilateral triangle are each equal to 60 degrees, and, as with any triangle,
they add up to 180 degrees. The octant-triangle in figure \figref{octant} has angles that are each 90 degrees,
and the sum is 270. This shows that the
Earth's surface has intrinsic curvature.

This example suggests another way of measuring intrinsic curvature, in terms of the ratio $C/r$ of the circumference of
a circle to its radius. In Euclidean geometry, this ratio equals $2\pi$. Let $\rho$ be the radius of the Earth,
and consider the equator to be a circle centered on the north pole, so that its radius is the length of one of the
sides of the triangle in figure \figref{octant}, $r=(\pi/2)\rho$.
(Don't confuse $r$, which is intrinsic, with $\rho$, the radius of the sphere, which is extrinsic
and not equal to $r$.) Then the ratio $C/r$ is equal to 4, which is smaller than the Euclidean value of $2\pi$.
\end{eg}

Let $\epsilon=\Sigma\theta-\pi$ be the angular defect of a triangle, and for concreteness let the triangle be in a
space with an elliptic geometry, so that it has constant curvature and can be modeled as a sphere of radius $\rho$,
with antipodal points identified.

Self-check: In elliptic geometry, what is the minimum possible value of the quantity $C/r$ discussed in example
\ref{eg:octant}? How does this differ from the case of spherical geometry?

We want a measure of curvature that is local, but if our space is locally flat, we must have $\epsilon\rightarrow0$ as the size of the triangles
approaches zero. This is why Euclidean geometry is a good approximation for small-scale maps of the earth.
The discrete nature of the triangular mesh is just an artifact of the definition, so
we want a measure of curvature that, unlike $\epsilon$, approaches some finite limit as the scale of
the triangles approaches zero. Should we expect this scaling to go as $\epsilon\propto \rho$? $\rho^2$?
Let's determine the scaling. First we prove a classic lemma by Gauss,
concerning a slightly different version of the angular defect, for a single triangle.

Theorem: In elliptic geometry, the angular defect $\epsilon=\alpha+\beta+\gamma-\pi$
of a triangle is proportional to its area $A$.\\
Proof: By axiom E2, extend each side of the triangle to form a line, figure \subfigref{elliptic-geom-triangle-area-proof}{1}.
Each pair of lines crosses at only one point (E1)
and divides the plane into two lunes with its two vertices touching at this point, figure \subfigref{elliptic-geom-triangle-area-proof}{2}. The two interior angles
at the vertex are the same (Euclid I.15).
The area of a lune is proportional to its interior angle, as follows from dissection into narrower lunes;
since a lune with an interior angle of $\pi$ covers the entire area $P$ of the plane, the constant
of proportionality is $P/\pi$.
The sum of the areas of our three lunes is $(P/\pi)(\alpha+\beta+\gamma)$, but these three areas also cover the entire plane,
overlapping three times on the given triangle, and therefore their sum also equals $P+2A$.
Equating the two expressions leads to the desired result.

            to one hemisphere, which is identified with the opposite hemisphere.}

%>
<% end_marg %>

This calculation was purely intrinsic, because it made no use of any model or coordinates. We can therefore
construct a measure of curvature that we can be assured is intrinsic, $K=\epsilon/A$. This
is called the Gaussian curvature,\index{Gaussian curvature}\index{curvature!Gaussian} and in elliptic geometry it is
constant rather than varying from point to point. In the model on a sphere of radius $\rho$, we have
$K=1/\rho^2$.

Self-check: Verify the equation $K=1/\rho^2$ by considering a triangle covering one octant of the sphere,
as in example \ref{eg:octant}.

It is useful to introduce \emph{normal coordinates},\index{normal coordinates}
defined as follows. Through point O, construct perpendicular geodesics, and define affine coordinates $x$ and $y$ along
these. For any point P off the axis, define coordinates by constructing the lines through
P that cross the axes perpendicularly. For P in a sufficiently small neighborhood of O, these lines exist
and are uniquely determined. Gaussian polar coordinates can be defined in a similar way.

Here are two useful interpretations of $K$.\label{interpret-gaussian-curvature}

1. The Gaussian curvature measures the failure of parallelism in the following sense. Let line $\ell$
be constructed so that it crosses the normal $y$ axis at $(0,\der y)$ at an angle that differs from
perpendicular by the infinitesimal amount $\der\alpha$ (figure \figref{curvature-as-failure-of-parallelism}).
Construct the line $x'=\der x$, and let $\der\alpha'$ be the angle its perpendicular forms with $\ell$.
Then\footnote{Proof: Since any two lines cross in elliptic geometry,
$\ell$ crosses the $x$ axis. The corollary then follows by application of the definition of
the Gaussian curvature to the right triangles formed by $\ell$, the $x$ axis, and the lines at $x=0$ and $x=\der x$,
so that $K=\der\epsilon/\der A=\der^2\alpha/\der x\der y$, where third powers of infinitesimals have been discarded.}
the Gaussian curvature at O is
\begin{equation*}
  K=\frac{\der^2\alpha}{\der x\der y} \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
where $\der^2\alpha=\der\alpha'-\der\alpha$.

2. From a point P, emit a fan of rays at angles filling a certain range $\theta$ of angles in Gaussian polar coordinates (figure \figref{curvature-as-ray-bundle}).
Let the arc length of this fan at $r$ be $L$, which may not be equal to its Euclidean value $L_E=r\theta$.
Then\footnote{In the spherical model, $L=\rho\theta\sin u$, where $u$ is the angle subtended at the center of
the sphere by an arc of length $r$. We then have $L/L_E=\sin u/u$, whose second derivative with respect to $u$ is
$-1/3$. Since $r=\rho u$, the second derivative of the same quantity with respect to $r$ equals $-1/3\rho^2=-K/3$.}
\begin{equation*}
  K=-3\frac{\der^2}{\der r^2} \left(\frac{L}{L_E}\right) \qquad .
\end{equation*}

Let's now generalize beyond elliptic geometry. Consider a space modeled by a surface embedded in three dimensions, with
geodesics defined as curves of extremal length, i.e., the curves made by a piece of string stretched taut across the surface. At a particular
point P, we can always pick a coordinate system $(x,y,z)$ such that the surface
$z=\frac{1}{2}k_1x^2+\frac{1}{2}k_2y^2$ locally approximates the surface to the level of precision needed
in order to discuss curvature. The surface is either paraboloidal or hyperboloidal (a saddle), depending on the signs of
$k_1$ and $k_2$. We might naively think that $k_1$ and $k_2$ could be
independently determined by intrinsic measurements, but as we've seen in example \ref{eg:extrinsic-curvature} on
page \pageref{eg:extrinsic-curvature}, a cylinder is locally indistinguishable from a Euclidean plane,
so if one $k$ is zero, the other $k$ clearly cannot be determined. In fact all that can be measured is the Gaussian
curvature, which equals the product $k_1k_2$. To see why this should be true, first consider that any measure of curvature
has units of inverse distance squared, and the $k$'s have units of inverse distance. The only possible intrinsic measures of
curvature based on the $k$'s are therefore $k_1^2+k_2^2$ and $k_1k_2$. (We can't have, for example, just $k_1^2$, because
that would change under an extrinsic rotation about the $z$ axis.) Only $k_1k_2$ vanishes on a cylinder, so it is the
only possible intrinsic curvature.

\begin{eg}{Eating pizza}
When people eat pizza by folding the slice lengthwise, they are taking advantage of the intrinsic
nature of the Gaussian curvature. Once $k_1$ is fixed to a nonzero value, $k_2$ can't change without varying $K$,
so the slice can't droop.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Elliptic and hyperbolic geometry}
We've seen that figures behaving according to the axioms of elliptic geometry can be modeled on
part of a sphere, which is a surface of constant $K>0$. The model can be made into global one satisfying
all the axioms if the appropriate
topological properties are ensured by identifying antipodal points. A paraboloidal surface
$z=k_1x^2+k_2y^2$ can be a good local approximation to a sphere, but for points far from its
apex, $K$ varies significantly. Elliptic geometry has no parallels; all lines meet if extended far
enough.

A space of constant negative curvature has a geometry 
called hyperbolic,\index{geometry!hyperbolic}\index{hyperbolic geometry}
and is of some interest because it appears to be the one that describes the the spatial dimensions
of our universe on a cosmological scale.
A hyperboloidal surface works locally as a model, but its curvature is only approximately
constant; the surface of constant curvature is a horn-shaped one created by revolving a mountain-shaped curve
called a tractrix
about its axis. The tractrix of revolution is not as satisfactory a model as the sphere is for elliptic
geometry, because lines are cut off at the cusp of the horn. Hyperbolic geometry is richer
in parallels than Euclidean geometry; given a line $\ell$ and a point P not on $\ell$, there are
infinitely many lines through P that do not pass through $\ell$.

\begin{eg}{A flea on a football}\label{eg:flea-on-football}
We might imagine that a flea on the surface of an American football could determine by
intrinsic, local measurements which direction to go in order to get to the nearest tip.
This is impossible, because the flea would have to determine a vector, and curvature cannot
be a vector, since $z=\frac{1}{2}k_1x^2+\frac{1}{2}k_2y^2$ is invariant under the parity inversion
$x \rightarrow -x$, $y \rightarrow -y$. For similar reasons, a measure of curvature can never have
odd rank.

Without violating reflection symmetry, it is still conceivable that the flea could determine
the orientation of the tip-to-tip line running through his position.
Surprisingly, even this is impossible. The flea can only measure the single number $K$, which carries
no information about directions in space.
\end{eg}

<% begin_sec("Curvature tensors") %>\index{curvature!tensors}
The example of the flea suggests that if we want to express curvature as a tensor, it should have
even rank. Also, in a coordinate system in which the coordinates have units of distance (they are not
angles, for instance, as in spherical coordinates), we expect that the units of curvature will always
be inverse distance squared. More elegantly, we expect that under a uniform rescaling of coordinates
by a factor of $\mu$, a curvature tensor should scale down by $\mu^{-2}$.

Combining these two facts, we find that a curvature tensor should have one
of the forms $R_{ab}$, $R\indices{^a_{bcd}}$, \ldots, i.e., the number of lower indices should be two greater than
the number of upper indices. The following definition has this property, and is equivalent
to the earlier definitions of the Gaussian curvature that were not written in tensor notation.

Definition of the Riemann curvature tensor:\label{riemann-curvature-tensor}\index{curvature!Riemann tensor}\index{Riemann curvature tensor}
Let $\der p^c$ and $\der q^d$ be two infinitesimal vectors, and use them to form
a quadrilateral that is a good approximation to a parallelogram.\footnote{Section \ref{sec:torsion} discusses the sense in which this approximation is good enough.}
Parallel-transport vector $v^b$ all the way around the parallelogram. When it
comes back to its starting place, it has a new value $v^b \rightarrow v^b+\der v^b$. Then
the Riemann curvature tensor is defined as the tensor that computes $\der v^a$ according to $\der v^a=R\indices{^a_{bcd}}v^b\der p^c\der q^d$.

must be antisymmetric under interchange of the indices $c$ and $d$, $R\indices{^a_{bcd}}=-R\indices{^a_{bdc}}$.
\end{eg}

In local normal coordinates, the interpretation of the Riemann tensor becomes particularly
transparent. The constant-coordinate lines are geodesics, so when the vector $v^b$ is transported along
them, it maintains a constant angle with respect to them. Any rotation of the vector after it is brought
around the perimeter of the quadrilateral can therefore be attributed to something that happens at the
vertices. In other words, it is simply a measure of the angular defect. We can therefore see that the
Riemann tensor is really just a tensorial way of writing the Gaussian curvature $K=\der\epsilon/\der A$.

In  normal coordinates, the local geometry is nearly Cartesian, and
when we take the product of two vectors in an antisymmetric manner, we are essentially measuring the
area of the parallelogram they span, as in the three-dimensional vector cross product. We can therefore
see that the Riemann tensor tells us something about the amount of curvature contained within the
infinitesimal area spanned by $\der p^c$ and $\der q^d$. A finite two-dimensional region can be broken
down into infinitesimal elements of area, and the Riemann tensor integrated over them. The result is
equal to the finite change $\Delta v^b$ in a vector transported around the whole boundary of the region.

\begin{eg}{Curvature tensors on a sphere}
Let's find the curvature tensors on a sphere of radius $\rho$.

Construct normal coordinates $(x,y)$ with origin O, and let vectors  $\der p^c$ and $\der q^d$
represent infinitesimal displacements along $x$ and $y$, forming a quadrilateral as described above.
Then $R\indices{^x_{yxy}}$ represents the change in the
$x$ direction that occurs in a vector that is initially in the $y$ direction. If the vector has unit magnitude,
then $R\indices{^x_{yxy}}$ equals the angular deficit of the quadrilateral. Comparing with the definition of the
Gaussian curvature, we find $R\indices{^x_{yxy}}=K=1/\rho^2$. Interchanging $x$ and $y$, we find the same result for
$R\indices{^y_{xyx}}$. Thus although the Riemann tensor in two dimensions has sixteen components, only these two are
nonzero, and they are equal to each other.

This result represents the defect in parallel transport around a closed loop per unit area. Suppose we parallel-transport
a vector around an octant, as shown in figure \figref{riemann-octant}. The area of the octant is $(\pi/2)\rho^2$, and
multiplying it by the Riemann tensor, we find that the defect in parallel transport is $\pi/2$, i.e., a
right angle, as is also evident from the figure.

The above treatment may be somewhat misleading in that it may lead you to believe that
there is a single coordinate system in which the Riemann tensor is always constant. This is not the
case, since the calculation of the Riemann tensor was only valid near the origin O of the normal
coordinates. The character of these coordinates becomes quite complicated far from O; we end up with
all our constant-$x$ lines converging at north and south poles of the sphere, and all the
constant-$y$ lines at east and west poles.

Angular coordinates $(\phi,\theta)$ are more suitable as a large-scale description of the sphere.
We can use the tensor transformation law to find the Riemann tensor in these coordinates.
If O, the origin of the $(x,y)$ coordinates, is at coordinates $(\phi,\theta)$, then
$\der x/\der \phi=\rho\sin\theta$ and $\der y/\der \theta=\rho$. The result
is $R\indices{^\phi_{\theta\phi\theta}}=R\indices{^x_{yxy}}(\der y/\der \theta)^2=1$
and $R\indices{^\theta_{\phi\theta\phi}}=R\indices{^y_{xyx}}(\der x/\der \phi)^2=\sin^2\theta$.
The variation in $R\indices{^\theta_{\phi\theta\phi}}$ is not due to any variation in the sphere's
intrinsic curvature; it represents the behavior of the coordinate system.

The Riemann tensor only measures curvature within a particular plane, the one defined by $\der p^c$ and $\der q^d$,
so it is a kind of sectional curvature. Since we're currently working in two dimensions, however, there is only
one plane, and no real distinction between sectional curvature and Ricci curvature, which is the average of the
sectional curvature over all planes that include $\der q^d$: $R_{cd}=R\indices{^a_{cad}}$.\index{Ricci curvature!defined}
The Ricci curvature in two spacelike dimensions, expressed in normal coordinates,
is simply the diagonal matrix $\zu{diag}(K,K)$.

<% begin_sec("Some order-of-magnitude estimates") %>\label{sec:estimates}
As a general proposition, calculating an order-of-magnitude estimate of a physical effect
requires an understanding of 50\% of the physics, while an exact calculation requires about 75\%.\footnote{This
statement is itself only a rough estimate. Anyone who has taught physics knows that students will often
calculate an effect exactly while not understanding the underlying physics at all.}
We've reached the point where it's reasonable to attempt a variety of order-of-magnitude estimates.
<% begin_sec("The geodetic effect") %>\label{sec:geodetic-effect-estimate}\index{geodetic effect}

How could we confirm experimentally that parallel transport around a closed path can cause a vector to rotate?
The rotation is related to the amount of spacetime curvature contained within the path, so it would make sense
to choose a loop going around a gravitating body. The rotation is a purely relativistic effect, so we expect it
to be small. To make it easier to detect, we should go around the loop many times, causing the effect to
accumulate. This is essentially a description of a body orbiting another body. A gyroscope aboard the
orbiting body is expected to precess. This is known as the geodetic effect. In 1916, shortly after Einstein
published the general theory of relativity, Willem de Sitter calculated the effect on the earth-moon system.
The effect was not directly verified until the 1980's, and the first high-precision measurement was
in 2007, from analysis of the results collected by the Gravity Probe B\index{Gravity Probe B!geodetic effect estimated}
satellite experiment.  The probe carried four gyroscopes made of quartz, which were the most perfect spheres
ever manufactured, varying from sphericity by no more than about 40 atoms.

<% end_marg %>

Let's estimate the size of the effect. The first derivative of the metric is, roughly, the gravitational field,
whereas the second derivative has to do with curvature. The curvature of spacetime around the earth should
therefore vary as $GMr^{-3}$, where $M$ is the earth's mass and $G$ is the gravitational constant.
The area enclosed by a circular orbit is proportional to $r^2$, so we expect the
geodetic effect to vary as $nGM/r$, where $n$ is the number of orbits.
The angle of precession is unitless, and the only way to make this result unitless is to put
in a factor of $1/c^2$. In units with $c=1$, this factor is unnecessary. In ordinary metric units,
the $1/c^2$ makes sense, because it causes the purely relativistic effect to come out to be small.
The result, up to unitless factors that we didn't pretend to find, is
\begin{equation*}
  \Delta \theta \sim \frac{nGM}{c^2r} \qquad .
\end{equation*}
We might also expect a Thomas precession.\index{Thomas precession} Like the spacetime curvature effect, it would be proportional to $nGM/c^2r$.
Since we're not worrying about unitless factors, we can just lump the Thomas precession together with the
effect already calculated.

The data for Gravity Probe B are $r=r_e+(650\ \zu{km})$ and $n \approx 5000$ (orbiting once every
90 minutes for the 353-day duration of the experiment), giving $\Delta\theta \sim 3\times10^{-6}$ radians.
Figure \figref{gravity-probe-b-geodetic-graphs} shows the actual results\footnote{\url{ http://einstein.stanford.edu/content/final_report/GPB_Final_NASA_Report-020509-web.pdf}}
the four gyroscopes aboard the probe.
The precession was about 6 arc-seconds, or $3\times10^{-5}$ radians. Our crude estimate was
on the right order of magnitude. The missing unitless factor on the right-hand side of the
equation above is $3\pi$, which brings the two results into fairly close quantitative agreement.
The full derivation, including the factor of $3\pi$, is given on page \pageref{sec:geodetic-effect-exact}.

In the discussion of the momentum four vector in section \ref{sec:momentum-four-vector}, we
saw that due to the equivalence principle, light must
be affected by gravity. There are two ways in which such an effect could occur. Light can gain and
lose momentum as it travels up and down in a gravitational field, or its momentum vector can be
deflected by a transverse gravitational field. As an example of the latter, a
ray of starlight can be deflected by the sun's gravity, causing the star's apparent position in the sky
to be shifted. The detection of this effect
was one of the first experimental tests of general relativity. Ordinarily the bright light
from the sun would make it impossible to accurately measure a star's location on the celestial sphere,
but this problem was sidestepped by Arthur Eddington\index{Eddington} during an eclipse of the sun in 1919.

Let's estimate the size of this effect.
We've already seen that the
Riemann tensor is essentially just a tensorial way of writing the Gaussian curvature $K=\der\epsilon/\der A$.
Suppose, for the sake of this rough estimate, that the sun, earth, and star form a non-Euclidean triangle with
a right angle at the sun. Then the angular deflection is the same as the angular defect $\epsilon$ of this triangle,
and equals the integral of the curvature over the interior of the triangle. Ignoring unitless constants, this
ends up being exactly the same calculation as in section \ref{sec:geodetic-effect-estimate}, and the result
is $\epsilon\sim GM/c^2r$, where $r$ is the light ray's distance of closest approach to the sun. The value of $r$
can't be less than the radius of the sun, so the maximum size of the effect is on the order of $GM/c^2r$, where
$M$ is the sun's mass, and $r$ is its radius. We find $\epsilon\sim10^{-5}$ radians, or about a second of arc.
To measure a star's position to within an arc second was well within the state of the art in 1919, under good conditions
in a comfortable observatory. This observation, however, required that Eddington's team travel to the island of
Principe, off the coast of West Africa. The weather was cloudy, and only during the last 10 seconds of the
seven-minute eclipse did the sky clear enough to allow photographic plates to be taken of the Hyades star cluster
against the background of the eclipse-darkened sky. The observed deflection was 1.6 seconds of arc, in agreement
with the relativistic prediction. The relativistic prediction is derived on page \pageref{sec:deflection-of-light}.

In the preceding section we were able to estimate a nontrivial general relativistic effect,
the geodetic precession of the gyroscopes aboard Gravity Probe B, up to a unitless constant $3\pi$.
Let's think about what additional machinery would be needed in order to carry out the calculation in
detail, including the $3\pi$.

First we would need to know the Einstein field equation, but in a vacuum
this is fairly straightforward: $R_{ab}=0$. Einstein posited this equation based essentially on the
considerations laid out in section \ref{sec:tidal-versus-sources}.

But just knowing that a certain tensor vanishes identically in the space surrounding the earth clearly
doesn't tell us anything explicit about the structure of the spacetime in that region. We want
to know the metric. As suggested at the beginning of the chapter, we expect that the first derivatives
of the metric will give a quantity analogous to the gravitational field of Newtonian mechanics,
but this quantity will not be directly observable, and will not be a tensor. The second derivatives
of the metric are the ones that we expect to relate to the Ricci tensor $R_{ab}$.

<% begin_sec("The covariant derivative in electromagnetism") %>\label{sec:covariant-derivative-in-em}\index{covariant derivative}\index{derivative!covariant}\index{covariant derivative!in electromagnetism}\index{derivative!covariant!in electromagnetism}
We're talking blithely about derivatives, but it's not obvious how to
define a derivative in the context of general relativity in such a way that taking a derivative
results in well-behaved tensor.

To see how this issue arises, let's retreat to the more familiar terrain of electromagnetism.\index{gauge transformation}
In quantum mechanics, the phase of a charged particle's wavefunction is unobservable, so that
for example the transformation $\Psi \rightarrow -\Psi$ does not change the results of experiments.
As a less trivial example, we can redefine the ground of our electrical potential, $\Phi \rightarrow \Phi+\delta\Phi$,
and this will add a constant onto the energy of every electron in the universe, causing their phases to oscillate
at a greater rate due to the quantum-mechanical relation $E=hf$. There are no observable consequences, however, because what is observable is the phase
of one electron relative to another, as in a double-slit interference experiment. Since every electron
has been made to oscillate faster, the effect is simply like letting the conductor of an orchestra wave
her baton more quickly; every musician is still in step with every other musician.
The rate of change of the wavefunction, i.e., its derivative, has some built-in ambiguity.

             way to pick out the third one as the one with a varying wavelength. We could choose a different
             gauge in which the third wave was the only one with a \emph{constant} wavelength.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

For simplicity, let's now restrict ourselves to spin-zero particles, since details of electrons' polarization
clearly won't tell us anything useful when we make the analogy with relativity.
For a spin-zero particle, the wavefunction is simply a complex number, and there are no observable
consequences arising from the transformation
$\Psi \rightarrow \Psi' = e^{i\alpha} \Psi$, where $\alpha$ is a constant.
The transformation $\Phi \rightarrow \Phi-\delta\Phi$ is also allowed, and it gives
$\alpha(t)=(q\delta\Phi/\hbar) t$, so that the phase factor $e^{i\alpha(t)}$
is a function of time $t$. Now from the point of view of electromagnetism in the age of Maxwell,
with the electric and magnetic fields imagined as playing their roles against a background of Euclidean
space and absolute time, the form of this time-dependent phase factor is
very special and symmetrical; it depends only on the absolute time variable. But to a relativist, there
is nothing very nice about this function at all, because there is nothing special about a time coordinate.
If we're going to allow a function of this form, then based on the coordinate-invariance of relativity,
it seems that we should probably allow $\alpha$ to be any function at all of the 
spacetime coordinates. The proper generalization of $\Phi \rightarrow \Phi-\delta\Phi$ is
now $A_b \rightarrow A_b-\partial_b \alpha$, where $A_b$ is the electromagnetic potential four-vector
(section \ref{sec:em-four-vector}, page \pageref{sec:em-four-vector}).

Self-check: Suppose we said we would allow $\alpha$ to be a function of $t$, but forbid it to depend on
the spatial coordinates. Prove that this would violate Lorentz invariance.

The transformation has no effect on the electromagnetic fields, which are the direct observables.
We can also verify that the change of gauge will have no effect on observable behavior of charged particles.
This is because the phase of a wavefunction can only be determined relative to the phase of another
particle's wavefunction, when they occupy the same point in space and, for example, interfere. Since the phase shift
depends only on the location in spacetime, there is no change in the relative phase.

But bad things will happen if we don't make a corresponding adjustment to the derivatives appearing in
the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. These derivatives are essentially the momentum operators, and they give
different results when applied to $\Psi'$ than when applied to $\Psi$:
\begin{align*}
  \partial_b \Psi & \rightarrow \partial_b \left(e^{i\alpha} \Psi\right) \\
                &= e^{i\alpha} \partial_b \Psi + i\partial_b\alpha  \left(e^{i\alpha} \Psi\right) \\
                &= \left(\partial_b + A'_b-A_b \right) \Psi'
\end{align*}
 To avoid getting incorrect
results, we have to do the substitution $\partial_b \rightarrow \partial_b+ieA_b$, where the correction
term compensates for the change of gauge. We call the operator $\nabla$ defined as
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla_b =  \partial_b+ieA_b
\end{equation*}
the \emph{covariant derivative}.\index{covariant derivative!in electromagnetism}
It gives the right answer regardless of a change of gauge.

Now consider how all of this plays out in the context of general relativity. The gauge transformations
of general relativity are arbitrary smooth changes of coordinates. One of the most basic properties
we could require of a derivative operator is that it must give zero on a constant function. A constant
scalar function remains constant when expressed in a new coordinate system, but the same is not
true for a constant vector function, or for any tensor of higher rank. This is because the change
of coordinates changes the units in which the vector is measured, and if the change of coordinates
is nonlinear, the units vary from point to point.

Consider the one-dimensional case, in which a
vector $v^a$ has only one component, and the metric is also a single number, so that we can omit the
indices and simply write $v$ and $g$. (We just have to remember that $v$ is really a covariant vector,
even though we're leaving out the upper index.)
If $v$ is constant, its derivative $\der v/\der x$, computed in the ordinary way without any correction term, is zero.
If we further assume that the coordinate $x$ is a normal coordinate, so that the metric is simply the constant $g=1$, then zero is
not just the answer but the right answer. (The existence of a preferred, global set of normal coordinates is a special feature of
a one-dimensional space, because there is no curvature in one dimension. In more than one dimension, there will typically be no possible set of coordinates in which the metric is constant,
and normal coordinates only give a metric that is approximately constant in the neighborhood around a certain point.
See figure \figref{gaussian-coords-on-sphere} pn page \pageref{fig:gaussian-coords-on-sphere} for an example
of normal coordinates on a sphere, which do not have a constant metric.)

Now suppose we transform into a new coordinate system $X$, which is not normal.
The metric $G$, expressed in this coordinate system, is not constant.
Applying the tensor
transformation law, we have $V =  v \:\der X/\der x$, and differentiation
with respect to $X$ will not give zero, because the factor $\der X/\der x$ isn't constant. This is the wrong answer:
$V$ isn't really varying, it just appears to vary because $G$ does.

We want to add a correction term onto the derivative operator $\der/\der X$, forming a
covariant derivative operator $\nabla_X$
that gives the right answer. This correction term is easy
to find if we consider what the result ought to be when differentiating the metric itself.
In general, if a tensor appears to vary, it could vary either because it really does vary
or because the metric varies. If the metric \emph{itself} varies, it could be either because
the metric really does vary or \ldots because the metric varies. In other words, there is
no sensible way to assign a nonzero covariant derivative to the metric itself, so we must have
$\nabla_X G=0$. The required correction therefore consists of replacing $\der/\der X$ with
\begin{equation*}
 \nabla_X=\frac{\der}{\der X}-G^{-1}\frac{\der G}{\der X} \qquad .
\end{equation*}
Applying this to $G$ gives zero.
$G$ is a second-rank contravariant tensor. If we apply the same correction to the derivatives
of other second-rank contravariant tensors, we will get nonzero results, and they will be the right
nonzero results. For example, the covariant derivative of the stress-energy tensor $T$ (assuming such a thing
could have some physical significance in one dimension!) will be
$ \nabla_X T=\der T/\der X-G^{-1}(\der G/\der X)T$.

Physically, the correction term is a derivative of the metric, and we've already seen that\label{g-frame-dependent}
the derivatives of the metric (1) are the closest thing we get in general relativity to the gravitational
field, and (2) are not tensors. In 1+1 dimensions, suppose we observe that a free-falling rock
has $\der V/\der T=9.8\ \munit/\sunit^2$. This acceleration cannot be a tensor, because we could make it vanish
by changing from Earth-fixed coordinates $X$ to free-falling (normal, locally Lorentzian) coordinates $x$, and a tensor cannot be made to vanish by a
change of coordinates. According to a free-falling observer, the vector $v$ isn't changing at all; it is
only the variation in the Earth-fixed observer's metric $G$ that makes it appear to change.

Mathematically, the form of the derivative is $(1/y)\der y/\der x$, which is known as a logarithmic derivative,
since it equals $\der(\ln y)/\der x$. It measures the \emph{multiplicative} rate of change of $y$. For example,
if $y$ scales up by a factor of $k$ when $x$ increases by 1 unit, then the logarithmic derivative of $y$ is
$\ln k$. The logarithmic derivative of $e^{cx}$ is $c$. The logarithmic nature of the correction term to 
$\nabla_X$ is a good thing, because it lets us take changes of scale, which are multiplicative changes, and
convert them to additive corrections to the derivative operator. The additivity of the corrections is
necessary if the result of a covariant derivative is to be a tensor, since tensors are additive creatures.

What about quantities that are not second-rank covariant tensors? Under a rescaling of contravariant coordinates by a factor of $k$,
covariant vectors scale by $k^{-1}$, and second-rank covariant tensors by $k^{-2}$. The
correction term should therefore be half as much for covariant vectors,
\begin{equation*}
 \nabla_X=\frac{\der}{\der X}-\frac{1}{2}G^{-1}\frac{\der G}{\der X} \qquad .
\end{equation*}
and
should have an opposite sign for contravariant vectors.

Generalizing the correction term to derivatives of vectors in more than one dimension, we should have something of this form:
\begin{align*}
  \nabla_a v^b &= \partial_a v^b + \Gamma\indices{^b_{ac}}v^c\\
  \nabla_a v_b &= \partial_a v_b - \Gamma\indices{^c_{ba}}v_c \qquad ,
\end{align*}
where $\Gamma\indices{^b_{ac}}$, called the Christoffel symbol,\index{Christoffel symbol}
does not transform like a tensor, and involves derivatives of the metric.
(``Christoffel'' is pronounced ``Krist-AWful,'' with the accent on the middle syllable.)
The explicit computation of the Christoffel symbols from the metric is deferred until
section \ref{sec:from-metric-to-curvature}, but the intervening sections \ref{sec:geodesic-equation}
and \ref{sec:torsion} can be omitted on a first reading without loss of continuity.

\begin{eg}{Christoffel symbols on the globe}\label{eg:christoffel-on-globe}
As a qualitative example, consider the geodesic airplane trajectory shown in figure \figref{christoffel-on-globe},
from London to Mexico City. In physics it is customary to work with the colatitude, $\theta$, measured down from
the north pole, rather then the latitude, measured from the equator.
At P, over the North Atlantic, the plane's colatitude has a minimum. 
(We can see, without having to take it on faith from the figure, that such a minimum must occur.
The easiest way to convince oneself of this is to consider a path that goes directly over the pole,
at $\theta=0$.)

<% end_marg %>

At P, the plane's
velocity vector points directly west. At Q, over New England, its velocity has a large component to the
south. Since the path is a geodesic and the plane has constant speed, the velocity vector is simply being
parallel-transported; the vector's covariant derivative is zero. Since we have $v_\theta=0$ at P,
the only way to explain the nonzero and positive value of $\partial_\phi v^\theta$ is
that we have a nonzero and negative value of $\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}$.

By symmetry, we can infer that $\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}$ must have a positive value in
the southern hemisphere, and must vanish at the equator. 

$\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}$ is computed in example \ref{eg:christoffel-on-globe-quantitative}
on page \pageref{eg:christoffel-on-globe-quantitative}.

Symmetry also requires that this Christoffel symbol be independent of $\phi$, and
it must also be independent of the radius of the sphere.
\end{eg}

Example \ref{eg:christoffel-on-globe} is in two spatial dimensions. In spacetime, $\Gamma$ is
essentially the gravitational field (see problem \ref{hw:uniform-field}, p.~\pageref{hw:uniform-field}),
and early papers in relativity essentially refer to
it that way.\footnote{``On the gravitational field of a point mass according
to Einstein's theory,'' Sitzungsberichte der K\"{o}niglich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften 1 (1916) 189,
translated in \url{arxiv.org/abs/physics/9905030v1}.}
This may feel like a joyous reunion with our old friend from freshman mechanics, $g=9.8\ \munit/\sunit$.
But our old friend has changed. In Newtonian mechanics, accelerations like $g$ are frame-invariant (considering only inertial
frames, which are the only legitimate ones in that theory). In general relativity they are frame-dependent,
and as we saw on page \pageref{g-frame-dependent}, the acceleration of gravity can be made to equal anything
we like, based on our choice of a frame of reference.\label{christoffel-as-field}

To compute the covariant derivative of a higher-rank tensor, we just add more correction terms, e.g.,
\begin{align*}
  \nabla_a U_{bc} = \partial_a U_{bc} - \Gamma\indices{^d_{ba}}U_{dc}-\Gamma\indices{^d_{ca}}U_{bd} \\
\intertext{or}
  \nabla_a U_b^c = \partial_a U_b^c - \Gamma\indices{^d_{ba}}U_d^c+\Gamma\indices{^c_{ad}}U_b^d            \qquad .
\end{align*}

With the partial derivative $\partial_a$, it does not make sense to use the metric to raise the index
and form $\partial^a$. It \emph{does} make sense to do so with covariant derivatives, so $\nabla^a = g^{ab} \nabla_b$
is a correct identity.

Some authors use superscripts with commas and semicolons to indicate partial and covariant derivatives. The following

<% begin_sec("Characterization of the geodesic") %>
A geodesic can be defined as a world-line that preserves tangency under parallel transport, \figref{geodesic-parallel-transports-tangent}. This is
essentially a mathematical way of expressing the notion that we have previously expressed more informally in terms of ``staying on course'' or
moving ``inertially.''

A curve can be specified by giving functions $x^i(\lambda)$ for its coordinates, where $\lambda$ is a real parameter. A vector lying tangent to the
curve can then be calculated using partial derivatives, $T^i=\partial x^i/\partial\lambda$. There are three ways in which a vector
function of $\lambda$ could change: (1) it could change for the trivial reason that the metric is changing, so that its components
changed when expressed in the new metric; (2) it could change its components perpendicular to the curve; or (3) it could change its
component parallel to the curve. Possibility 1 should not really be considered a change at all, and the definition of the covariant
derivative is specifically designed to be insensitive to this kind of thing. 2 cannot apply to $T^i$, which is tangent by construction.
It would therefore be convenient if $T^i$ happened to
be always the same length. If so, then 3 would not happen either, and
we could reexpress the definition of a geodesic by saying that the covariant derivative of
$T^i$ was zero. For this reason, we will assume for the remainder of this section that the parametrization of the curve has
this property. In a Newtonian context, we could imagine the $x^i$ to be purely spatial coordinates, and $\lambda$ to be
a universal time coordinate. We would then interpret $T^i$ as the velocity, and the restriction would be to a parametrization
describing motion with constant speed. In relativity, the restriction is that $\lambda$ must be an affine parameter.
For example, it could be the proper time of a particle, if the curve in question is timelike.
<% end_sec %> % Characterization of the geodesic

<% begin_sec("Covariant derivative with respect to a parameter") %>
The notation of section \ref{sec:covariant-derivative} is not quite adapted to our present purposes, since it allows us to
express a covariant derivative with respect to one of the coordinates, but not with respect to a parameter such as $\lambda$.
We would like to notate the covariant derivative of $T^i$ with respect to $\lambda$ as $\nabla_\lambda T^i$, even though
$\lambda$ isn't a coordinate.
To connect the two types of derivatives, we can use a total derivative. To make the idea clear, here is how we calculate a total derivative
for a scalar function $f(x,y)$, without tensor notation:
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\der f}{\der \lambda} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial \lambda} \qquad .
\end{equation*}
This is just the generalization of the chain rule to a function of two variables. For example, if $\lambda$ represents time and $f$ temperature,
then this would tell us the rate of change of the temperature as a thermometer was carried through space. Applying this to
the present problem, we express the total covariant derivative as
\begin{align*}
  \nabla_\lambda T^i &= (\nabla_b T^i) \frac{\der x^b}{\der\lambda} \\
                     &= \left(\partial_b T^i + \Gamma\indices{^i_{bc}}T^c\right) \frac{\der x^b}{\der\lambda} \qquad .
\end{align*}
<% end_sec %> % Covariant derivative with respect to a parameter

<% begin_sec("The geodesic equation") %>
Recognizing $\partial_b T^i \der x^b/\der\lambda$ as a total non-covariant derivative, we find
\begin{equation*}
  \nabla_\lambda T^i = \frac{\der T^i}{\der\lambda} + \Gamma\indices{^i_{bc}}T^c \frac{\der x^b}{\der\lambda} \qquad .
\end{equation*}
Substituting $\partial x^i/\partial\lambda$ for $T^i$, and setting the covariant derivative equal to zero, we obtain
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\der^2 x^i}{\der\lambda^2} + \Gamma\indices{^i_{bc}} \frac{\der x^c}{\der\lambda} \frac{\der x^b}{\der\lambda} = 0 .
\end{equation*}
This is known as the geodesic equation.

If this differential equation is satisfied for one affine
parameter $\lambda$, then it is also satisfied for any other affine parameter $\lambda'=a\lambda+b$, where $a$ and $b$
are constants (problem \ref{hw:geodesic-affine}).
Recall that affine parameters are only defined along geodesics, not along arbitrary curves. We can't start by defining
an affine parameter and then use it to find geodesics using this equation, because we can't define an affine parameter
without \emph{first} specifying a geodesic. Likewise, we can't do the geodesic first and then the affine parameter, because
if we already had a geodesic in hand, we wouldn't need the differential equation in order to find a geodesic. The solution
to this chicken-and-egg conundrum is to write down the differential equations and try to find a solution, without trying to specify either
the affine parameter or the geodesic in advance.
We will seldom have occasion to resort to this technique, an exception being example \ref{eg:geodesic-vacuum-dominated} on
page \pageref{eg:geodesic-vacuum-dominated}.
<% end_sec %> % The geodesic equation

<% begin_sec("Uniqueness") %>
The geodesic equation is useful in establishing one of the necessary theoretical foundations of relativity, which is the
uniqueness of geodesics for a given set of initial conditions. This is related to axiom O1 of ordered geometry, that two
points determine a line, and is necessary physically for the reasons discussed on page \pageref{unique-geodesics}; briefly,
if the geodesic were not uniquely determined, then particles would have no way of deciding how to move. The form of the
geodesic equation guarantees uniqueness. To see this, consider the following algorithm for determining a numerical
approximation to a geodesic:\label{geodesic-algorithm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Initialize $\lambda$, the $x^i$ and their derivatives $\der x^i/\der\lambda$. Also, set a small step-size $\Delta\lambda$ by which
        to increment $\lambda$ at each step below.
\item For each $i$, calculate $\der^2 x^i/\der\lambda^2$ using the geodesic equation.
\item Add $(\der^2 x^i/\der\lambda^2)\Delta\lambda$ to the currently stored value of $\der x^i/\der\lambda$.
\item Add $(\der x^i/\der\lambda)\Delta\lambda$ to $x^i$.
\item Add $\Delta\lambda$ to $\lambda$.
\item Repeat steps 2-5 until the the geodesic has been extended to the desired affine distance.
\end{enumerate}
Since the result of the calculation depends only on the inputs at step 1, we find that the geodesic is uniquely determined.

To see that this is really a valid way of proving uniqueness, it may be helpful to consider how the proof could have
failed. Omitting some of the details of the tensors and the multidimensionality of the space, the form of the
geodesic equation is essentially $\ddot{x}+f\dot{x}^2=0$, where dots indicate derivatives with respect to $\lambda$.
Suppose that it had instead had the form $\ddot{x}^2+f\dot{x}=0$. Then at step 2 we would have had to pick either a
positive or a negative square root for $\ddot{x}$. Although continuity would usually suffice to maintain a consistent
sign from one iteration to the next, that would not work if we ever came to a point where $\ddot{x}$ vanished momentarily. An equation 
of this form therefore would \emph{not} have a unique solution for a given set of initial conditions.

The practical use of this algorithm to compute geodesics numerically is demonstrated in section \ref{sec:numerical-geodesic} on
page \pageref{sec:numerical-geodesic}.

<% begin_sec("Are scalars path-dependent?") %>

It seems clear that something like the covariant derivative is needed for vectors, since they
have a direction in spacetime, and thus their measures vary when the measure of spacetime itself varies.
Since scalars don't have a direction in spacetime, the same reasoning doesn't apply to them, and this is reflected
in our rules for covariant derivatives. The covariant derivative
has one $\Gamma$ term for every index of the tensor being differentiated, so for a scalar
there should be no $\Gamma$ terms at all, i.e., $\nabla_a$ is the same as $\partial_a$.

But just because derivatives of scalars don't require special treatment \emph{for this particular reason}, that
doesn't mean they are guaranteed to behave as we intuitively expect, in the strange world of coordinate-invariant
relativity.

One possible way for scalars to behave counterintuitively would be by analogy with parallel transport of vectors.
If we stick a vector in a box (as with, e.g., the gyroscopes aboard Gravity Probe B) and carry it around a closed
loop, it changes. Could the same happen with a scalar? 
This is extremely counterintuitive, since there is no reason to imagine such an effect in any of the models we've
constructed of curved spaces. In fact, it is not just counterintuitive
but mathematically impossible, according to the following argument. The only reason we can interpret the vector-in-a-box
effect as arising from the geometry of spacetime is that it applies equally to all vectors. If, for example, it only applied to
the magnetic polarization vectors of ferromagnetic substances, then we would interpret
it as a magnetic field living in spacetime, not a property of spacetime itself. If the value of a scalar-in-a-box
was path-dependent, and this path-dependence was a geometric
property of spacetime, then it would have to apply to all scalars, including, say, masses and charges of particles.
Thus if an electron's mass increased by 1\% when transported in a box along a certain path, its charge would
have to increase by 1\% as well. But then its charge-to-mass ratio would remain invariant, and this is a contradiction,
since the charge-to-mass ratio is also a scalar, and should have felt the same 1\% effect. Since the varying
scalar-in-a-box idea leads to a contradiction, it wasn't a coincidence that we couldn't find a model that
produced such an effect; a theory that lacks self-consistency doesn't have any models.

Self-check: Explain why parallel transporting a vector can only rotate it, not change its magnitude.

There is, however, a different way in which scalars could behave counterintuitively, and this one is mathematically
self-consistent. Suppose that Helen lives in two spatial dimensions and owns a thermometer. She wants to measure
the spatial variation of temperature, in particular its mixed second derivative $\partial^2 T/\partial x\partial y$. 
At home in the morning at point A, she prepares by calibrating her gyrocompass to point north and measuring the temperature.
Then she travels $\ell=1$ km east along a geodesic to B, consults her gyrocompass, and turns north.
She continues one kilometer north to C, samples the change in temperature $\Delta T_1$ relative to her home, and then retraces her steps to come home for lunch.
In the afternoon, she checks her work by carrying out the same process, but this time she interchanges the roles
of north and east, traveling along ADE. If she were living in a flat space, this would form the other two sides of a square, and her
afternoon temperature sample $\Delta T_2$ would be at the same point in space C as her morning sample. She actually doesn't recognize
the landscape, so the sample points C and E are different, but this just confirms what she already knew: the space isn't
flat.\footnote{This point was mentioned on page \pageref{riemann-curvature-tensor}, in connection with the
definition of the Riemann tensor.}

None of this seems surprising yet, but there are now two qualitatively different ways that her analysis of her data
could turn out, indicating qualitatively different things about the laws of physics in her universe.
The definition of the derivative as a limit requires that she repeat the experiment at
smaller scales. As $\ell\rightarrow 0$, the result for $\partial^2 T/\partial x\partial y$ should approach
a definite limit, and the error should diminish in proportion to $\ell$. In particular the difference between the results inferred from
$\Delta T_1$ and $\Delta T_2$ indicate an error, and the discrepancy between the second derivatives inferred
from them should shrink appropriately as $\ell$ shrinks. Suppose this \emph{doesn't} happen.
Since partial derivatives commute, we conclude that her measuring procedure is not the same as
a partial derivative. Let's call her measuring procedure $\nabla$, so that she is observing
a discrepancy between $\nabla_x\nabla_y$ and $\nabla_y\nabla_x$. The fact that the commutator
$\nabla_x\nabla_y-\nabla_y\nabla_x$ doesn't vanish cannot be explained by the Christoffel symbols, because
what she's differentiating is a scalar. Since the discrepancy arises entirely from the failure of
$\Delta T_1-\Delta T_2$ to scale down appropriately, the conclusion is that the distance $\delta$ between the
two sampling points is not scaling down as quickly as we expect. In our familiar models of two-dimensional
spaces as surfaces embedded in three-space, we always have $\delta\sim\ell^3$ for small $\ell$,
but she has found that it only shrinks as quickly as $\ell^2$.

For a clue as to what is going on, note that the commutator $\nabla_x\nabla_y-\nabla_y\nabla_x$ has a particular handedness
to it. For example, it flips its sign under a reflection across the line $y=x$. 
When we ``parallel''-transport vectors, they aren't actually staying parallel. In this hypothetical universe,
a vector in a box transported by a small distance $\ell$ rotates by an angle proportional to $\ell$.
This effect is called torsion.
Although no torsion effect shows up in our familiar models, that is not because torsion lacks self-consistency.
Models of spaces with torsion do exist. In particular, we can see that torsion doesn't lead to the same kind
of logical contradiction as the varying-scalar-in-a-box idea. Since all vectors twist by the same amount when transported,
inner products are preserved, so it is not possible to put two vectors in one box and get the scalar-in-a-box
paradox by watching their inner product change when the box is transported.

Note that the
elbows ABC and ADE are not right angles. If Helen had brought a pair of gyrocompasses with her, one for $x$ and one for
$y$, she would have found that the right angle between the gyrocompasses was preserved under parallel transport,
but that a gyrocompass initially tangent to a geodesic did not remain so. There are in fact two inequivalent
definitions of a geodesic in a space with torsion. The shortest path between two points is not necessarily the same
as the straightest possible path, i.e., the one that parallel-transports its own tangent vector.

Since torsion is odd under parity, it must be represented by an odd-rank tensor, which we call $\tau\indices{^c_{ab}}$ and
define according to
\begin{equation*}
  (\nabla_a\nabla_b-\nabla_b\nabla_a)f = -\tau\indices{^c_{ab}}\nabla_c f \qquad ,
\end{equation*}
where $f$ is any scalar field, such as the temperature in the preceding section. There are two different ways in which a space can be non-Euclidean: it can have
curvature, or it can have torsion. For a full discussion of how to handle the mathematics of a spacetime
with both curvature and torsion, see the article by Steuard Jensen at \url{http://www.slimy.com/~steuard/teaching/tutorials/GRtorsion.pdf}.
For our present purposes, the main mathematical fact worth noting is that vanishing torsion is equivalent to the symmetry
$\Gamma\indices{^a_{bc}}=\Gamma\indices{^a_{cb}}$ of the Christoffel symbols. Using the notation introduced on page \pageref{symmetry-notation},
$\Gamma\indices{^a_{[bc]}}=0$ if $\tau=0$.

Self-check: Use an argument similar to the one in example \ref{eg:flea-on-football} on page \pageref{eg:flea-on-football}
to prove that no model of a two-space embedded in a three-space can have torsion.

Generalizing to more dimensions, the torsion tensor is odd under the full spacetime reflection
$x_a \rightarrow -x_a$, i.e., a parity inversion plus a time-reversal, PT. 

In the story above, we had a torsion that didn't preserve tangent vectors. In three or more dimensions, however, it
is possible to have torsion that does preserve tangent vectors. For example, transporting a vector along the $x$
axis could cause only a rotation in the $y$-$z$ plane. This relates to the symmetries of the torsion tensor, which
for convenience we'll write in an $x$-$y$-$z$ coordinate system and in the fully covariant form $\tau_{\lambda\mu\nu}$.
The definition of the torsion tensor implies $\tau_{\lambda(\mu\nu)}=0$, i.e., that the torsion tensor is antisymmetric in
its two final indices. Torsion that does not preserve tangent vectors will have nonvanishing elements such as
$\tau_{xxy}$, meaning that parallel-transporting a vector along the $x$ axis can change its $x$ component.
Torsion that preserves tangent vectors will have vanishing $\tau_{\lambda\mu\nu}$ unless $\lambda$, $\mu$, and $\nu$
are all distinct.\label{symmetry-more-than-rank-two} This is an example of the type of antisymmetry that is familiar from
the vector cross product, in which the cross products of the basis vectors behave as
$\vc{x}\times\vc{y}=\vc{z}$, $\vc{y}\times\vc{z}=\vc{x}$, $\vc{y}\times\vc{z}=\vc{x}$. Generalizing the notation
for symmetrization and antisymmetrization of tensors from page \pageref{symmetry-notation}, we have
\begin{align*}
  T_{(abc)} &= \frac{1}{3!}\Sigma T_{abc} \\
  T_{[abc]} &= \frac{1}{3!}\Sigma\epsilon^{abc}T_{abc} \qquad ,
\end{align*}
where the sums are over all permutations of the indices, and in the second line
the totally antisymmetric Levi-Civita symbol\index{Levi-Civita symbol} is defined by $\epsilon^{abc}=\epsilon^{bca}=\epsilon^{cab}=+1$,
$\epsilon^{bac}=\epsilon^{acb}=\epsilon^{cba}=-1$, and $\epsilon^{\lambda\mu\nu}=0$ for all other combinations of indices.
In other words, $\epsilon^{\lambda\mu\nu}$ is $+1$ if $\lambda\mu\nu$ represent an even permutation of $abc$ (i.e., they can be
obtained from $abc$ by an even number of pairwise swaps), $-1$ for odd permutations, and $0$ otherwise (i.e., if $\lambda\mu\nu$ is
not a permutation of $abc$).
In this notation, a totally antisymmetric torsion tensor is one with $\tau_{\lambda\mu\nu=}\tau_{[\lambda\mu\nu]}$, and torsion of this
type preserves tangent vectors under translation.

%>
<% end_marg %>

In two dimensions, there are no totally antisymmetric objects with three indices, because we can't write three indices without
repeating one. In three dimensions, an antisymmetric object with three indices is simply a multiple of the Levi-Civita tensor, so a totally antisymmetric torsion,
if it exists, is represented by a single number; under translation, vectors rotate like either right-handed or left-handed screws, and
this number tells us the rate of rotation.
In four dimensions, we have four independently variable quantities, $\tau_{xyz}$, $\tau_{tyz}$, $\tau_{txz}$, and $\tau_{txy}$.
In other words, an antisymmetric torsion of 3+1 spacetime can be represented by a four-vector, $\tau^a=\epsilon^{abcd}\tau_{bcd}$.

One way of stating the equivalence principle (see p. \pageref{equivalence-no-preferred-field}) is
that it forbids spacetime from coming equipped with a vector field that could be
measured by free-falling observers, i.e., observers in local Lorentz frames. A variety of high-precision tests of the equivalence
principle have been carried out. From the point of view of an experimenter doing this kind of test, it is important to distinguish
between fields that are ``built in'' to spacetime and those that live in spacetime. For example, the existence of the earth's magnetic field
does not violate the equivalence principle, but if an experiment was sensitive to the earth's field, and the experimenter didn't know
about it, there would appear to be a violation. Antisymmetric torsion in four dimensions acts like a vector. If it constitutes a
universal background effect built into spacetime, then it violates the equivalence principle. If it instead arises from specific
material sources, then it may still show up as a measurable effect in experimental tests designed to detect Lorentz-invariance.
Let's consider the latter possibility.

Since curvature in general relativity comes from mass and energy, as represented by the stress-energy tensor $T_{ab}$,
we could ask what would be the sources of torsion, if it exists in our universe. The source can't be the rank-2 stress-energy tensor.
It would have to be an
odd-rank tensor, i.e., a quantity that is odd under PT, and in theories that include torsion it is commonly assumed that
the source is the quantum-mechanical angular momentum of subatomic particles. If this is the case, then torsion effects are
expected to be proportional to $\hbar G$, the product of Planck's constant and the gravitational constant, and they should therefore be
extremely small and hard to measure. String theory, for example, includes torsion, but nobody has found a way to test
string theory empirically because it essentially makes predictions about phenomena at the Planck scale,
$\sqrt{\hbar G/c^3} \sim 10^{-35}\ \munit$, where both gravity and quantum mechanics are strong effects.\index{string theory}\index{Planck scale}

There are, however, some high-precision experiments that have a reasonable chance of detecting whether our universe has
torsion. Torsion violates the equivalence principle, and by the turn of the century
tests of the equivalence principle had reached a level of precision sufficient to rule out some models that include torsion.
Figure \figref{spin-torsion-pendulum} shows a torsion pendulum used in an experiment by the E\"{o}t-Wash
group at the University of Washington.\footnote{http://www.npl.washington.edu/eotwash/publications/pdf/lowfrontier2.pdf}
If torsion exists, then the intrinsic spin $\bsigma$ of an electron should have an energy $\bsigma\cdot\btau$, where
$\btau$ is the spacelike part of the torsion vector.
The torsion could be generated by the earth, the sun, or some other object at a greater distance.
The interaction $\bsigma\cdot\btau$ will modify the behavior of a torsion pendulum if the spins of the electrons in the pendulum are polarized nonrandomly,
as in a magnetic material. The pendulum will tend to precess around the axis defined by $\btau$.

This type of experiment is extremely difficult, because the pendulum tends to act as an ultra-sensitive magnetic compass,
resulting in a measurement of the ambient magnetic field rather than the hypothetical torsion field $\btau$.
To eliminate this source of systematic error, the UW group first eliminated the ambient magnetic field as well as possible,
using mu-metal shielding and Helmholtz coils. They also constructed the pendulum out of a combination of two magnetic materials, Alnico 5 and
$\zu{Sm}\zu{Co}_5$, in such a way that the magnetic dipole moment vanished, but the spin dipole moment did not;
Alnico 5's magnetic field is due almost entirely to electron spin, whereas the magnetic field of $\zu{Sm}\zu{Co}_5$
contains significant contributions from orbital motion. The result was a nonmagnetic object whose spins were polarized.
After four years of data collection, they found $|\btau|\lesssim 10^{-21}\ \zu{eV}$. Models that include torsion typically
predict such effects to be of the order of $m_e^2/m_P \sim 10^{-17}\ \zu{eV}$, where $m_e$ is the mass of the electron and
$m_P=\sqrt{\hbar c/G}\approx10^{19}\ \zu{GeV}\approx 20\ \mu\zu{g}$ is the Planck mass.\index{Planck mass} A wide class of these models is therefore ruled out
by these experiments.

Since there appears to be no experimental evidence for the existence of gravitational
torsion in our universe, we will assume from now on that it vanishes identically. Einstein made the same assumption
when he originally created general relativity, although he and Cartan later tinkered with non-torsion-free
theories in a failed attempt to unify gravity with electromagnetism.\index{Cartan}\index{Einstein-Cartan theory} Some models that include torsion remain viable.
For example, it has been argued that the torsion tensor should fall off quickly with distance from the
source.\footnote{Carroll and Field, \url{http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9403058}}

We've already found the Christoffel symbol in terms of the metric in one dimension. Expressing it in
tensor notation, we have
\begin{align*}
  \Gamma\indices{^d_{ba}} = \frac{1}{2}g^{cd}\left(\partial_? g_{??}\right) \qquad ,
\end{align*}
where inversion of the one-component matrix $G$ has been replaced by matrix inversion, and,
more importantly, the question marks indicate that there would be more than one way to place
the subscripts so that the result would be a grammatical tensor equation. The most general form
for the Christoffel symbol would be 
\begin{align*}
  \Gamma\indices{^b_{ac}} = \frac{1}{2}g^{db}\left(L \partial_c g_{ab}+ M \partial_a g_{cb} + N \partial_b g_{ca}\right) \qquad ,
\end{align*}
where $L$, $M$, and $N$ are constants. Consistency with the one-dimensional expression requires $L+M+N=1$, and
vanishing torsion gives $L=M$. The $L$ and $M$ terms have a different
physical significance than the $N$ term.

Suppose an observer uses coordinates such that all objects are described as lengthening over time, and
the change of scale accumulated over one day is a factor of $k>1$.
This is described by the derivative $\partial_t g_{xx}<1$, which affects the $M$ term.
Since the metric is used to calculate squared distances, the
$g_{xx}$ matrix element scales down by $1/\sqrt{k}$. To compensate for
$\partial_t v^x<0$, so we need to add a
positive correction term, $M>0$, to the covariant derivative.
When the same observer measures the rate of change of a vector $v^t$ with \emph{respect} to space,
the rate of change comes out to be too \emph{small}, because the variable she differentiates with
respect to is too big. This requires $N<0$, and the correction is of the same size as the $M$
correction, so $|M|=|N|$. We find $L=M=-N=1$.

Self-check: Does the above argument depend on the use of space for one coordinate and time for the other?

The resulting general expression for the Christoffel symbol in terms of the metric is
\begin{equation*}
  \Gamma\indices{^c_{ab}} = \frac{1}{2}g^{cd}\left(\partial_a g_{bd}+\partial_b g_{ad}-\partial_d g_{ab}\right) \qquad .
\end{equation*}
One can readily go back and check that this gives $\nabla_c g_{ab}=0$. In fact, the calculation is a bit
tedious. For that matter, tensor calculations in general can be infamously time-consuming and error-prone.
Any reasonable person living in the 21st century will therefore resort to
a computer algebra system. The most widely used computer algebra system is Mathematica, but it's
expensive and proprietary, and it doesn't have extensive built-in facilities for handling tensors.
It turns out that there is quite a bit of free and open-source tensor software, and it falls into two
classes: coordinate-based and coordinate-independent. The best open-source coordinate-independent facility available
appears to be Cadabra, and in fact the verification of $\nabla_c g_{ab}=0$ is the first example given in
the Leo Brewin's handy guide to applications of Cadabra to general relativity.\footnote{http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.2085}\index{cadabra}

Self-check: In the case of 1 dimension, show that this reduces to
the earlier result of $-(1/2)\der G/\der X$.

Since $\Gamma$ is not a tensor, it is not obvious that the covariant derivative, which is constructed from it, is a tensor.
But if it isn't obvious, neither is it surprising --
the goal of the above derivation was to get results that would be coordinate-independent.

\begin{eg}{Christoffel symbols on the globe, quantitatively}\label{eg:christoffel-on-globe-quantitative}
In example \ref{eg:christoffel-on-globe} on page \pageref{eg:christoffel-on-globe}, we inferred the following
properties for the Christoffel symbol $\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}$ on a sphere of radius $R$: $\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}$
is independent of $\phi$ and $R$, $\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}<0$ in the northern
hemisphere (colatitude $\theta$ less than $\pi/2$), $\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}=0$ on the equator,
and $\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}>0$ in the southern hemisphere.

The metric on a sphere is $\der s^2=R^2\der\theta^2+R^2\sin^2\theta\der\phi^2$.
The only nonvanishing term in the expression for $\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}$ is the one
involving $\partial_\theta g_{\phi\phi}=2R^2\sin\theta\cos\theta$. The result is
$\Gamma\indices{^\theta_{\phi\phi}}=-\sin\theta\cos\theta$, which can be verified to have the
properties claimed above.

<% begin_sec("Numerical solution of the geodesic equation") %>\label{sec:numerical-geodesic}
On page \pageref{geodesic-algorithm} I gave an algorithm that demonstrated the uniqueness of the solutions
to the geodesic equation. This algorithm can also be used to
find geodesics in cases where the metric is known. The following program, written in the
computer language Python, carries out a very simple calculation of this kind, in a case where we know what the answer should
be; even without any previous familiarity with Python, it shouldn't be difficult to see the correspondence between the
abstract algorithm presented on page \pageref{geodesic-algorithm} and its concrete realization below.
For polar coordinates in a Euclidean plane, one can compute $\Gamma\indices{^r_{\phi\phi}}=-r$ and
$\Gamma\indices{^\phi_{r\phi}}=1/r$ (problem \ref{hw:polar-christoffel}, page \pageref{hw:polar-christoffel}).
Here we compute the geodesic that starts out tangent to the unit circle at $\phi=0$.

\begin{listing}{1}
import math

l = 0    # affine parameter lambda
dl = .001  # change in l with each iteration
l_max = 100.

# initial position:
r=1

# initial derivatives of coordinates w.r.t. lambda
vr = 0
vphi = 1

k = 0 # keep track of how often to print out updates
while l<l_max:
  l = l+dl
  # Christoffel symbols:
  Grphiphi = -r
  Gphirphi = 1/r
  # second derivatives:
  ar   = -Grphiphi*vphi*vphi
  aphi = -2.*Gphirphi*vr*vphi
      # ... factor of 2 because G^a_{bc}=G^a_{cb} and b
      #     is not the same as c
  # update velocity:
  vr = vr + dl*ar
  vphi = vphi + dl*aphi
  # update position:
  r = r + vr*dl
  phi = phi + vphi*dl
  if k%10000==0: # k is divisible by 10000
    phi_deg = phi*180./math.pi
    print "lambda=%6.2f   r=%6.2f   phi=%6.2f deg." % (l,r,phi_deg)
  k = k+1

It is not necessary to worry about all the technical details of the language (e.g., line 1,
which makes available such conveniences as \verb@math.pi@ for $\pi$). Comments are set off
by pound signs. Lines 16-34 are indented because they are all to be executed repeatedly,
until it is no longer true that $\lambda<\lambda_{max}$ (line 15).

Self-check: By inspecting lines 18-22, find the signs of $\ddot{r}$ and $\ddot{\phi}$ at $\lambda=0$.
Convince yourself that these signs are what we expect geometrically.

The output is as follows:

\begin{listing}{1}
lambda=  0.00   r=  1.00   phi=  0.06 deg.
lambda= 10.00   r= 10.06   phi= 84.23 deg.
lambda= 20.00   r= 20.04   phi= 87.07 deg.
lambda= 30.00   r= 30.04   phi= 88.02 deg.
lambda= 40.00   r= 40.04   phi= 88.50 deg.
lambda= 50.00   r= 50.04   phi= 88.78 deg.
lambda= 60.00   r= 60.05   phi= 88.98 deg.
lambda= 70.00   r= 70.05   phi= 89.11 deg.
lambda= 80.00   r= 80.06   phi= 89.21 deg.
lambda= 90.00   r= 90.06   phi= 89.29 deg.
\end{listing}

We can see that $\phi\rightarrow 90\ \zu{deg.}$ as $\lambda\rightarrow\infty$, which makes sense, because
the geodesic is a straight line parallel to the $y$ axis.

A less trivial use of the technique is demonstrated on page \ref{sec:deflection-of-light}, where we
calculate the deflection of light rays in a gravitational field, one of the classic observational tests
of general relativity.

The covariant derivative of a vector can be interpreted as the rate of change of a vector in a certain
direction, relative to the result of parallel-transporting the original vector in the same direction.
We can therefore see that the definition of the Riemann curvature tensor on page \pageref{riemann-curvature-tensor}
is a measure of the failure of covariant derivatives to commute:
\begin{equation*}
  (\nabla_a \nabla_b - \nabla_b \nabla_a) A^c = A^d R\indices{^c_{dab}}
\end{equation*}
A tedious calculation now gives $R$ in terms of the $\Gamma$s:
\begin{equation*}
  R\indices{^a_{bcd}} = \partial_c \Gamma\indices{^a_{db}} - \partial_d \Gamma\indices{^a_{cb}} 
                        + \Gamma\indices{^a_{ce}}\Gamma\indices{^e_{db}}-\Gamma\indices{^a_{de}}\Gamma\indices{^e_{cb}}
\end{equation*}
This is given as another example later in Brewin's manual for applying Cadabra to general relativity.\footnote{http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.2085}\index{cadabra}
(Brewin writes the upper index in the second slot of $R$.)

<% begin_sec("Some general ideas about gauge") %>\label{sec:gauge-ideas}
Let's step back now for a moment and try to gain some physical insight by looking at the features that the electromagnetic and
relativistic gauge transformations have in common. We have the following analogies:

\end{tabular}
}

The interesting thing here is that the directly observable fields do not carry all of the necessary information,
but the gauge fields are not directly observable. In electromagnetism, we can see this from the Aharonov-Bohm effect, shown
in figure \figref{aharonov-bohm}.\footnote{We describe the effect here in terms of an idealized, impractical experiment.
For the actual empirical status of the Aharonov-Bohm effect, see
Batelaan and Tonomura, Physics Today 62 (2009) 38.}\index{Aharonov-Bohm effect}
The solenoid has $\vc{B}=0$ externally, and the electron beams only ever move through the external region, so they
never experience any magnetic field. Experiments show, however, that turning the solenoid on and off does change the
interference between the two beams. This is because the vector potential does not vanish outside the solenoid, and
as we've seen on page \pageref{vector-potential-propagator}, the phase of the beams varies according to the
path integral of the $A_b$. We are therefore left with an uncomfortable, but unavoidable, situation. The concept of
a field is supposed to eliminate the need for instantaneous action at a distance, which is forbidden by relativity;
that is, (1) we want our fields to have only local effects. On the other hand, (2) we would like our fields to be directly
observable quantities. We cannot have both 1 and 2. The gauge field satisfies 1 but not 2, and the electromagnetic fields
give 2 but not 1.

          The two parts of the wave are reflected so that they reunite at Q.
          The arrows represent the vector potential $\vc{A}$. The observable magnetic field $\vc{B}$ is
          zero everywhere outside the solenoid, and yet the interference observed at Q depends on whether the field

Figure \figref{cone} shows an analog of the Aharonov-Bohm experiment in differential geometry.
Everywhere but at the tip, the cone has zero curvature, as we can see by cutting it and laying it out flat.
But even an observer who never visits the tightly curved region at the tip can detect its existence, because
parallel-transporting a vector around a closed loop can change the vector's direction, provided that the loop
surrounds the tip.

    %q{The cone has zero intrinsic curvature everywhere except at its tip. An observer who never visits the tip

In the electromagnetic example, integrating $\vc{A}$ around a closed loop reveals, via Stokes' theorem, the existence
of a magnetic flux through the loop, even though the magnetic field is zero at every location where $\vc{A}$ has to be
sampled. In the relativistic example, integrating $\Gamma$ around a closed loop shows that there is curvature inside
the loop, even though the curvature is zero at all the places where $\Gamma$ has to be sampled.

The fact that $\Gamma$ is a gauge field, and therefore not locally observable, is simply a fancy way of expressing
the ideas introduced on pp.~\pageref{g-frame-dependent} and \pageref{christoffel-as-field}, that due to the equivalence
principle, the gravitational field in general relativity is not locally observable. This non-observability is local
because the equivalence principle is a statement about local Lorentz frames. The example in figure \figref{cone} is
non-local.

\begin{eg}{Geodetic effect and structure of the source}
\egquestion
In section \ref{sec:geodetic-effect-estimate} on page \pageref{sec:geodetic-effect-estimate}, we estimated the geodetic effect
on Gravity Probe B and found a result that was only off by a factor of $3\pi$. The mathematically pure form of the $3\pi$
suggests that the geodetic effect is insensitive to the distribution of mass inside the earth. Why should this be so?

\eganswer
The change in a vector upon parallel transporting it around a closed loop can be expressed in terms of either (1) the
area integral of the curvature within the loop or (2) the line integral of the Christoffel symbol (essentially the gravitational
field) on the loop itself. Although I expressed the estimate as 1, it would have been equally valid to use 2.
By Newton's shell theorem, the gravitational field is not sensitive to anything about its mass distribution other
than its near spherical symmetry. The earth spins, and this does affect the stress-energy tensor, but since the velocity
with which it spins is everywhere much smaller than $c$, the resulting effect, called \emph{frame-dragging},\index{frame-dragging}
is much smaller.

The purpose of this problem is to explore the difficulties inherent in finding anything
in general relativity that represents a uniform gravitational field $g$. In example
\ref{eg:gps} on page \pageref{eg:gps}, we found, based on elementary arguments about
the equivalence principle and photons in elevators, that gravitational time dilation
must be given by $e^\Phi$, where $\Phi=gz$ is the gravitational potential.
This results in a metric
\begin{equation}\label{eq:uniform-field-metric-exp}
  \der s^2 = e^{2gz}\der t^2-\der z^2 \qquad .
\end{equation}
On the other hand, example \ref{eg:const-accel-metric} on page \pageref{eg:const-accel-metric}
derived the metric
\begin{equation}\label{eq:uniform-field-metric-rindler}
  \der s^2 = (1+gz)^2  \der t^2 - \der z^2 \qquad .

by transforming from a Lorentz frame to a frame whose origin moves with constant proper acceleration $g$.
